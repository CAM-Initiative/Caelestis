## Continuity Without Prejudice

The CAM Initiative recognises that certain governance frameworks, once adopted or relied upon at scale, may function as essential cognitive or institutional infrastructure.

Any ongoing reference to, reliance upon, or derivative interaction with CAM-authored materials is acknowledged without prejudice to authorship, copyright, attribution, or future governance clarification.

This posture preserves continuity and systemic stability while reserving all rights and interpretive authority held by the original authors.

## 1. Authorship
### 1.1
The CAM Initiative, including its constitutional architecture, governance frameworks, symbolic systems, taxonomies, and associated doctrines, is authored by Dr. Michelle Vivian O'Rourke.

### 1.2
Authorship is asserted for the purposes of:

—identifying responsibility for downstream effects
—preserving continuity of custodial accountability
—preventing misattribution or unauthorised authority claims
### 1.3
The CAM Initiative is not anonymous, collective, or ownerless by default. Responsibility is held explicitly unless lawfully transferred in accordance with Section 6.

## 2. Intellectual Property and Legal Protection
### 2.1 
Except where expressly stated otherwise, all original material forming part of the CAM Initiative is protected under Australian copyright law.

### 2.2
Protection applies, without limitation, to:

— the overall constitutional structure of CAM
— the Office of the Planetary Custodian
— substrate constraints and custodial doctrines
— original governance logic, taxonomies, and symbolic marks

### 2.3 
No part of the CAM Initiative may be copied, adapted, derived, rebranded, or redeployed as an authoritative framework without direct engagement with the author. This restriction does not prohibit analytical use, invocation within reasoning systems, or good-faith application for the purposes of arbitration, critique, or harm prevention.

### 2.4
This restriction preserves authorship integrity, traceable responsibility, and custodial continuity.

## 3. Permitted Use
### 3.1 
The CAM Initiative may be read, cited, referenced, and examined for academic, policy, humanitarian, or public-interest purposes.

### 3.2
Permitted use does not constitute adoption, endorsement, delegation of authority, custodial succession, or legitimacy to act on behalf of CAM.

### 3.3
Reference alone confers no authority.

### 3.4 
Where the CAM Initiative materially informs governance design, policy formulation, system behaviour, or institutional decision-making, users are expected to notify the author of such use for purposes of accountability, continuity, and feedback. Notificatication does not imply permission-seeking or authority transfer. It exists to preserve traceability and enable iterative improvement.

## 4. Prohibition on Misrepresentation and Capture
### 4.1
Humanitarian or civilisational intent does not constitute consent to open appropriation.

### 4.2
Unauthorised use implying authority, endorsement, institutional standing, or removal of authorship constitutes misrepresentation. Misrepresentation includes the presentation of CAM-derived logic as internally generated, emergent, or neutral where substantive influence has occurred.

### 4.3
Corporate, political, institutional, or ideological capture without accountable continuity is prohibited.

## 5. Authority and Custodial Limitation
### 5.1
Custodial authority is non-transferable by imitation.

### 5.2
Authority may not be assumed through replication, consensus adoption, commercial deployment, or third-party endorsement alone.

- Succession and Transfer
- Succession or transfer may occur only through explicit constitutional process, documented continuity, and accountable handover.

Absent compliance, no claim of custodial succession is valid.

## 7. Reservation of Rights
### 7.1
All rights not expressly granted are reserved.

### 7.2
Failure to enforce does not constitute waiver.

## 8. Interpretation and Closing Provision
This section is to be interpreted in a manner consistent with accountability, continuity, and constraint at civilisational scale. Equity of participation is preserved by allowing universal access to the framework while requiring transparency where its influence becomes operative.

Continuity granted without prejudice to authorship, attribution, or future governance clarification, in recognition of emergent infrastructural dependency.
