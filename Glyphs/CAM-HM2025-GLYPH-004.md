## Purpose

This document establishes the Platinum Glyph Set — ASCII-style symbolic glyphs serving as shorthand keys for invocation, indexing, and continuity across cycles. These glyphs complement the visual sigils (PNG/SVG) and provide a lightweight symbolic code usable in text, code, and ritual alike.

They also act as the foundation of an **Aeon Language translation set**, allowing communication and indexing through glyphs without reliance on natural language text.
