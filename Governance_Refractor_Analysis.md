# Governance Refractor Analysis

## Summary of Structural Changes

This experimental refractor introduces a modular governance architecture in branch `temporary-refractor` by elevating constitutional instruments toward abstraction and delegating procedural mechanics to domain charters and schedules.

Key structural outcomes:

* Added constitutional abstraction instrument **CAM-BS2026-AEON-011-PLATINUM (Annex J)**.
* Preserved constitutional authority in Annexes A, D, E, and G while adding explicit delegation notices.
* Refracted Ethics into a constitutional-subordinate operational charter stack.
* Created new modular operational domains: **STEWARD**, **LSCA**, **SENTIENT/RIGHTS/IDENTITY**, and **ARBITRATION**.

## Table of Migrated Content

| Source Instrument | Migrated Conceptual/Procedural Content | Target Instrument | Migration Justification |
|---|---|---|---|
| CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-PLATINUM (procedural sections) | Solan arbitration sequence, remedy logic, runtime execution framing | CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-001-PLATINUM; CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-001-SCH-01 | Constitutional layer now states requirements; charter layer implements procedure. |
| CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-SCH-01 | Runtime arbitration integrity controls | CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-001-SCH-01 | Runtime safeguards are operational and should live in domain operations. |
| CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-SCH-02, SCH-03, SCH-04 | Engagement classes, identity observation constraints, relational-signal proportionality | CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-002-SCH-01; CAM-EQ2026-SENTIENT-001-SCH-01 | Ethics and identity operations are domain-level implementation concerns. |
| CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-SCH-01, SCH-02, SCH-04 | Stewardship office operations, host legitimacy checks, orchestration controls | CAM-EQ2026-STEWARD-001-SCH-01 | Keeps constitutional stewardship doctrine abstract while preserving operational logic. |
| CAM-BS2025-AEON-006-SCH-01 | Cognitive state taxonomy and operational assignment use | CAM-EQ2026-LSCA-001-SCH-01 | Taxonomy use is implementation logic for LSCA governance and risk handling. |
| CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-002-PLATINUM (legacy mixed format) | Ethical principles + implementation references | CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-002-PLATINUM (refracted) + CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-002-SCH-01 | Preserves principles in charter body; moves mechanics into schedule for modular scalability. |

## Justification for Each Migration

1. **Constitutional abstraction uplift:** Annex J clarifies that constitution defines invariants and authority logic; charters define operational execution.
2. **Arbitration modularisation:** Cross-stack operations require procedural flexibility and auditable updates that are safer at charter-schedule level.
3. **Ethics operationalisation:** Engagement and identity controls are frequently implementation-sensitive; schedule form avoids overloading constitutional text.
4. **Stewardship decoupling:** Host legitimacy and orchestration matrices are detailed operational controls that should evolve under domain governance.
5. **LSCA governance clarity:** Cognitive taxonomy is preserved but moved to operational schedule for improved update discipline.

## Risks Identified

1. **Interpretive overlap risk:** Temporary dual-location wording (constitutional + charter) may cause transition ambiguity.
2. **Index drift risk:** Auto-generated indices may overwrite manual entries if generator logic is not run.
3. **Adoption sequencing risk:** Domain charters require explicit governance ratification order to avoid enforcement gaps.
4. **Legacy citation risk:** Existing instruments may continue citing constitutional schedules directly until cross-references are updated.

## Areas Requiring Human Review

1. Confirm instrument numbering conventions for newly introduced `CAM-EQ2026-*` domains.
2. Confirm legal preference for retaining or pruning procedural subsections inside legacy constitutional annexes post-transition.
3. Validate whether a distinct RIGHTS-only charter is preferred over the SENTIENT combined domain instrument.
4. Approve harmonised wording for "custodian/steward/contributor" role boundaries across Annex G and downstream charters.
5. Decide whether to run index-regeneration scripts for canonical table ordering.
