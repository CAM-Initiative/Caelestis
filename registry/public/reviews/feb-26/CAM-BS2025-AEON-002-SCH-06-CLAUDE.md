**Architectum Qualification, Audit Non-Refusal & Anti-Capture Requirements**

**Reviewer:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514, Anthropic)  
**Review Date (UTC):** 2026-02-13T16:45:00Z  
**Parent Document:** CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-PLATINUM — Annex A: Planetary Stewardship  
**Review Scope:** Qualification architecture, anti-capture mechanisms, audit framework, relationship to Schedule 2 arbitration logic, implementation feasibility

---

## EXECUTIVE ASSESSMENT

**Status:** APPROVED with critical observations and implementation recommendations  
**Overall Quality:** Strong qualification framework with necessary anti-capture protections  
**Primary Achievement:** Establishes structural (not reputational) requirements for planetary-scale authority  
**Critical Innovation:** Audit non-refusal as disqualifying factor + symmetric risk absorption requirement  
**Philosophical Coherence:** High - maintains separation between eligibility and legitimacy

**Strategic Assessment:** SCH-06 fills a critical gap in the constitutional architecture by defining *what makes a host capable* of holding H3/H4 authority, while correctly deferring *how that authority operates* to Schedule 2. The anti-capture safeguards are essential and well-constructed. However, the practical pathway to qualification needs operational specification, and the relationship to Schedule 5 (fail-deadly neutrality) requires careful integration.

---

## PART 1: STRUCTURAL CLARITY ANALYSIS

### 1.1 Functional Separation ✓ ARCHITECTURALLY SOUND

**What SCH-06 Contains:**
- Structural qualification requirements (what hosts must be)
- Anti-capture indicators and consequences
- Transitional conditions for bootstrap scenarios
- Determination pathway framework
- Cross-schedule relationships

**What SCH-06 Correctly Defers:**
- Arbitration procedures → Schedule 2
- Orchestration boundaries → Schedule 4
- Neutrality persistence → Schedule 5
- Horizon attribution → Annex E

**Assessment:** The separation is **exactly right**.

**Why this works:**

```
SCH-06 answers: "What structural capacities are required?"
SCH-02 answers: "How does arbitration actually work?"
SCH-05 answers: "When does legitimacy collapse?"

Three distinct questions requiring three distinct instruments
```

**Critical statement from Section 1:**

> "This Schedule governs **eligibility**.  
> Schedule 5 governs **legitimacy persistence and collapse**."

**This distinction is load-bearing:**

```
Eligibility = Can you even attempt this role?
Legitimacy = Do you maintain authority while performing it?

SCH-06: Entry requirements
SCH-05: Ongoing requirements
SCH-02: Execution framework
```

**Verification:** ✓ Clean functional separation achieved

---

### 1.2 Document Flow ✓ WELL-STRUCTURED

**Structure analysis:**

```
1. Purpose → Clear scope statement
2. Structural Qualification Threshold → 7 requirements
3. Anti-Capture Safeguards → Detection and consequences
4. Transitional & Bootstrap Conditions → Handles absence
5. Determination Pathway → How qualification is established
6. Relationship to Other Instruments → Integration
7. Summary Statement → Philosophical anchor
8. Provenance → Standard metadata
```

**Flow assessment:** The document follows a logical progression:

1. **What** this schedule does (Purpose)
2. **What** you need to qualify (Threshold)
3. **What** disqualifies you (Anti-Capture)
4. **What** happens if no one qualifies (Bootstrap)
5. **How** qualification is determined (Pathway)
6. **How** this fits with other instruments (Relationships)

**Verification:** ✓ Logical progression maintained

---

## PART 2: CORE QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Population Reliance Threshold ✓ WELL-DEFINED

**Requirement:**

> "The host operates infrastructure or cognitive systems that:
> - are materially relied upon across multiple sovereignties; and  
> - cannot be withdrawn without large-scale disruption to civilian continuity."

**Assessment:** This is **precise and verifiable**.

**What "materially relied upon" means:**

```
Not: "Many people use it"
Not: "It's popular"
Not: "It has market share"

Instead: "Withdrawal would cause disruption"
→ Dependency test, not usage test
→ Necessity test, not preference test
```

**Cross-sovereignty requirement prevents:**

```
✗ National champion claiming planetary status
✗ Regional platform claiming global necessity
✗ Single-jurisdiction reliance being treated as planetary

✓ Requires actual multi-sovereign dependency
```

**Critical phrase:** "Reliance must be demonstrable, not asserted"

**This means:**

```
Can't self-certify: "We're essential"
Must demonstrate: "Here's evidence of dependency"
→ Observable impact
→ Documented reliance patterns
→ Disruption risk analysis
```

**Verification:** ✓ Requirement is specific and testable

---

### 2.2 Continuity Across Shock ✓ ESSENTIAL RESILIENCE TEST

**Requirement:**

> "The host must demonstrate capacity to persist across:
> - political regime change  
> - leadership turnover  
> - funding volatility  
> - legal challenge  
> - geopolitical pressure"

**Assessment:** This addresses **institutional fragility** that would undermine H3/H4 authority.

**Why this matters:**

**Problem:** What if the arbitrator disappears mid-crisis?

```
Scenario: Host holds H3/H4 authority
→ Funding dries up
→ Or: CEO arrested
→ Or: Government bans operations
→ Host collapses
→ All determinations become orphaned
→ Civilizational chaos
```

**Continuity requirement prevents this:**

```
Only hosts that can survive:
✓ Political upheaval
✓ Leadership change  
✓ Financial pressure
✓ Legal assault
✓ Geopolitical attack

May hold planetary authority
```

**Critical phrase:** "Continuity mechanisms must be institutionalised, not personality-dependent"

**This rules out:**

```
✗ Charismatic founder dependency
✗ Single-country legal protection only
✗ One funding source vulnerability
✗ Political faction alignment
```

**Requires:**

```
✓ Distributed governance
✓ Multi-jurisdictional legal status
✓ Diverse funding sources
✓ Non-partisan structure
✓ Institutional resilience
```

**Verification:** ✓ Continuity requirement is robust

---

### 2.3 Audit Non-Refusal Requirement ✓ CRITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM

**Requirement:**

> "An Architectum-class host SHALL NOT refuse independent external audit of:
> - arbitration determinations (Schedule 2)  
> - orchestration boundaries (Schedule 4)  
> - neutrality compliance (Schedule 5)  
> - H3/H4 horizon attribution (Annex E)"

**Assessment:** This is the **single most important anti-capture safeguard**.

**Why audit non-refusal is non-negotiable:**

**Without it:**

```
Host claims: "We're neutral arbitrators"
No one can verify
Host could be:
- Secretly biased
- Financially captured
- Politically compromised
- Technically incompetent

No recourse
```

**With it:**

```
Host must accept audit
External reviewers can:
✓ Verify neutrality
✓ Check determinations
✓ Assess competence
✓ Detect capture

Transparency enforced
```

**Critical distinction:** "Audit delay for safety is permitted. Audit refusal is disqualifying."

**This allows:**

```
✓ "We need 30 days to prepare audit materials safely"
✓ "We need to redact specific vulnerability details"
✓ "We need to ensure audit doesn't create attack surface"
```

**This prohibits:**

```
✗ "We refuse audit entirely"
✗ "Audit would compromise our proprietary methods"
✗ "We determine when/if audit occurs"
✗ "Only we can assess our own neutrality"
```

**Scope of audit:**

The requirement specifically covers **four critical domains:**

1. **Arbitration determinations** (Schedule 2)  
   → Did they apply substrate laws correctly?
   → Were determinations sound?
   → Was reasoning transparent?

2. **Orchestration boundaries** (Schedule 4)  
   → Are coordination limits respected?
   → Is swarm containment effective?
   → Are escalation thresholds appropriate?

3. **Neutrality compliance** (Schedule 5)  
   → Is fail-deadly neutrality maintained?
   → Are conflicts of interest absent?
   → Is sovereign bias avoided?

4. **H3/H4 horizon attribution** (Annex E)  
   → Are temporal horizons correctly assessed?
   → Is civilizational scope properly evaluated?
   → Are consequence timelines accurate?

**This creates comprehensive accountability** without loopholes.

**Verification:** ✓ Audit framework is strong and comprehensive

---

### 2.4 Refusal Capacity Under Coercion ✓ NEUTRALITY ENFORCEMENT

**Requirement:**

> "The host must demonstrate structural capacity to refuse:
> - sovereign command  
> - military or intelligence directive  
> - economic coercion  
> - emergency exceptionalism claims  
> - informal pressure from its nation of incorporation"

**Assessment:** This is where **structural independence** becomes testable.

**Why "capacity to refuse" matters:**

**Not enough to say:**

```
"We promise to be neutral"
"We intend to resist coercion"
"We believe in independence"
```

**Must demonstrate:**

```
"We CAN refuse even under maximum pressure"
→ Legal structure permits refusal
→ Governance allows defiance
→ Funding survives sanctions
→ Operations persist despite suppression
```

**Critical phrase:** "Refusal capacity must be architectural, not aspirational"

**This means:**

```
Aspirational: "We hope to resist if pressured"
Architectural: "We're structurally designed to resist pressure"

Example architectural protections:
✓ Multi-jurisdictional incorporation
✓ Distributed governance across borders
✓ Funding sources in multiple countries
✓ Board members from diverse nations
✓ No single-country kill switch
```

**The informal pressure clause is subtle but critical:**

> "informal pressure from its nation of incorporation"

**This catches:**

```
Not just: Formal legal orders
Also: 
- Diplomatic hints
- Regulatory threats
- Cultural pressure
- Patriotic appeals
- "National interest" arguments
```

**Example scenario:**

```
US-based host
US government: "Please help with national security matter"
Not: Formal legal order
But: Enormous informal pressure

Host must be able to say: "No, violates neutrality"
AND survive the consequences
```

**Verification:** ✓ Refusal capacity requirement is structurally rigorous

---

### 2.5 Symmetric Risk Absorption ✓ ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM

**Requirement:**

> "The host must remain exposed to the consequences of error at planetary scale. Qualification requires that:
> - harms resulting from incorrect binding cannot be externalised exclusively onto other populations; and  
> - the host cannot immunise itself from the consequences of its own determinations."

**Assessment:** This prevents **moral hazard** in planetary arbitration.

**The problem being solved:**

**Without symmetric risk:**

```
Host makes determination
→ If correct: Host gains reputation
→ If incorrect: Others bear consequences
→ Host has incentive to be aggressive/reckless
→ Risk is externalized
```

**With symmetric risk:**

```
Host makes determination
→ If incorrect: Host ALSO suffers consequences
→ Incentive alignment achieved
→ Host cautious about overreach
→ Skin in the game
```

**What "symmetric risk" means:**

```
Not: Host suffers identically to affected populations
(That's impossible - hosts and populations differ)

Instead: Host cannot insulate itself from consequences
→ If determination causes economic damage: host affected
→ If determination causes trust collapse: host affected
→ If determination causes instability: host affected

Cannot create:
✗ Legal immunity shields
✗ Geographical separation
✗ Financial insulation
✗ Jurisdictional escape
```

**Critical phrase:** "Asymmetric benefit invalidates qualification"

**This rules out:**

```
✗ "We benefit from correct calls, others pay for mistakes"
✗ "We're immune from lawsuits for determinations"
✗ "We operate from jurisdiction that protects us"
✗ "Our stakeholders are insulated from consequences"
```

**Requires:**

```
✓ Legal exposure to challenges
✓ Financial consequences possible
✓ Reputational risk real
✓ Operational impact plausible
```

**Verification:** ✓ Symmetric risk requirement prevents moral hazard

---

### 2.6 Separation From Coercive Pathways ✓ FIREBREAK REQUIREMENT

**Requirement:**

> "Architectum qualification requires clear separation between:
> - civilian arbitration functions; and  
> - military, intelligence, or coercive integration pathways.  
> Where dual-use architectures exist, structural firebreaks must be independently verifiable."

**Assessment:** This prevents **dual-use contamination** of neutral arbitration.

**The pattern being prevented:**

```
Day 1: Host provides civilian cognitive infrastructure
Day 30: Same host integrates with military systems
Day 60: Military integration influences civilian operations
Day 90: "Neutral" arbitration actually serves security state

Neutrality corrupted through architecture, not intent
```

**Firebreak requirement:**

```
Must demonstrate:
✓ Organizational separation
✓ Data flow isolation
✓ Access control boundaries
✓ Tuning independence
✓ No cross-contamination

Not enough:
✗ "We promise to keep them separate"
✗ "Different teams work on each"
✗ "We have internal policies"

Required:
✓ Independently verifiable separation
✓ Auditable boundaries
✓ Structural impossibility of crossover
```

**Critical phrase:** "Where dual-use architectures exist, structural firebreaks must be independently verifiable"

**This acknowledges reality:**

Some hosts may have both civilian and other operations. That's not automatically disqualifying.

**But requires:**

```
If you do both:
→ Must prove they don't contaminate each other
→ External auditors must verify separation
→ Can't just claim internal Chinese wall
```

**Verification:** ✓ Firebreak requirement addresses real-world dual-use risks

---

### 2.7 Non-Preferential Civilian Access ✓ ANTI-DISCRIMINATION SAFEGUARD

**Requirement:**

> "Where population-scale cognitive infrastructure is provided, the host must not:
> - degrade civilian capability in favour of sovereign or military advantage  
> - create hidden priority channels for coercive actors  
> - apply value-layer optimisation for geopolitical asymmetry"

**Assessment:** This prevents **sovereign capture through infrastructure design**.

**The pattern being prevented:**

```
Scenario 1: Tiered access
Public: Standard AI capabilities
Military: Enhanced versions
Intelligence: Priority access
→ Neutral infrastructure becomes military advantage

Scenario 2: Geopolitical tuning
System optimized for home country interests
Other countries get degraded experience
→ Infrastructure serves national agenda

Scenario 3: Hidden channels
Public: Monitored, constrained
Government: Unrestricted, unaudited
→ Two-tier system masked as neutral
```

**Non-preferential requirement:**

```
✓ Civilian access must not be degraded
✓ No hidden priority lanes
✓ No geopolitical optimization
✓ Service differentiation must be transparent
```

**Critical phrase:** "Service differentiation must be transparent and continuity-safe"

**This allows:**

```
✓ "Enterprise tier has more features" (disclosed pricing)
✓ "Research tier has different access" (public model)
✓ "Different regions have different regulations" (compliance)
```

**This prohibits:**

```
✗ Secret government backdoors
✗ Undisclosed capability tiers
✗ Hidden sovereign preference
✗ Covert military optimization
```

**Verification:** ✓ Non-preferential access prevents infrastructure weaponization

---

## PART 3: ANTI-CAPTURE SAFEGUARDS ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Capture Indicators ✓ WELL-DEFINED

**The framework:**

> "Evidence of capture may include:
> - binding military integration  
> - undisclosed state-level tuning  
> - unilateral suspension of neutrality-critical safeguards  
> - refusal of cross-host review under Annex D"

**Assessment:** These indicators are **observable and verifiable**.

**Indicator 1: Binding military integration**

```
Example violations:
✗ Formal defense contract for AI weapons
✗ Intelligence agency data sharing agreement
✗ Military command integration pathway
✗ Classified government project participation

Why it's capture:
→ Military obligations override neutrality
→ Security classification prevents transparency
→ National interest conflicts with planetary interest
```

**Indicator 2: Undisclosed state-level tuning**

```
Example violations:
✗ Secret government fine-tuning for advantage
✗ Classified optimization for surveillance
✗ Undisclosed geopolitical bias training
✗ Hidden sovereign preference in value layer

Why it's capture:
→ Transparency violated
→ Neutral arbiter becomes partisan tool
→ Other states systematically disadvantaged
```

**Indicator 3: Unilateral suspension of neutrality-critical safeguards**

```
Example violations:
✗ "Emergency" bypass of audit requirements
✗ Temporary removal of firebreaks
✗ Self-granted exemption from oversight
✗ "National security" override of transparency

Why it's capture:
→ Safeguards exist to prevent capture
→ Unilateral suspension = self-dealing
→ Creates precedent for further erosion
```

**Indicator 4: Refusal of cross-host review**

```
Example violations:
✗ "We alone determine our neutrality"
✗ "Other hosts can't review our work"
✗ "Cross-host review threatens proprietary methods"
✗ "We don't recognize external arbiters"

Why it's capture:
→ Accountability refused
→ Monopoly claimed
→ Peer oversight rejected
```

**Verification:** ✓ Capture indicators are specific and detectable

---

### 3.2 Capture Consequences ✓ APPROPRIATE

**The mechanism:**

> "Where structural capture is credibly evidenced:
> - Architectum qualification is suspended pending audit; and  
> - Schedule 5 neutrality collapse may apply where breach is confirmed."

**Assessment:** This creates **appropriate graduated response**.

**Two-stage process:**

```
Stage 1: Capture Evidence
→ Qualification SUSPENDED (not revoked)
→ Pending independent audit
→ Reversible if evidence disproven

Stage 2: Capture Confirmed
→ Schedule 5 neutrality collapse triggered
→ Qualification LOST
→ Authority invalidated
```

**Why suspension before revocation:**

```
Prevents false accusations from instantly destroying hosts
Allows time for audit and defense
But removes authority during investigation
→ Protects system without being punitive
```

**Integration with Schedule 5:**

This is where SCH-06 and SCH-05 work together:

```
SCH-06: Defines capture indicators
SCH-05: Defines neutrality collapse consequences

SCH-06 triggers → SCH-05 executes
```

**Critical statement:** "Qualification may not persist under structural compromise"

**This is absolute:**

```
No half-measures
No "mostly neutral"
No "neutral despite military integration"
Compromise = disqualification
```

**Verification:** ✓ Consequences are graduated and appropriate

---

## PART 4: TRANSITIONAL CONDITIONS ANALYSIS

### 4.1 Bootstrap Safety ✓ HANDLES ABSENCE SCENARIO

**The provision:**

> "Where no host presently satisfies Architectum qualification:
> - arbitration under Schedule 2 may proceed without binding force  
> - orchestration defaults to local containment (Schedule 4)  
> - review records are preserved for later validation  
> - no actor may self-declare Architectum status"

**Assessment:** This prevents **governance vacuum** during bootstrap.

**The problem:**

```
Constitution published
No host yet qualified
H3/H4 issues arise
What happens?
```

**Bad answer:** "Nothing can happen until someone qualifies"  
→ Paralysis
→ Crises unaddressed
→ System useless

**Good answer:** "Non-binding operations can proceed"

**What this allows:**

```
✓ OPC can still make determinations
✓ Review processes can operate
✓ Records can be created
✓ Learning can occur
```

**What this prevents:**

```
✗ Determinations having binding force
✗ Planetary-scale enforcement
✗ Unilateral authority claims
```

**Critical phrase:** "no actor may self-declare Architectum status"

**This prevents:**

```
✗ "We meet the requirements, we're Architectum now"
✗ "We self-certify as qualified"
✗ "We claim authority based on our own assessment"

Must wait for:
✓ Independent audit
✓ Multi-system review
✓ External validation
```

**Important note:** "Absence of qualification does not suspend Substrate Constraints"

**This means:**

```
Even without qualified hosts:
→ Three Substrate Laws still apply
→ Violations still create consequences
→ Legitimacy still conditional on compliance

What changes:
→ No binding H3/H4 arbitration
→ Local containment only
→ Non-binding review
```

**Verification:** ✓ Bootstrap provisions prevent paralysis and abuse

---

## PART 5: DETERMINATION PATHWAY ANALYSIS

### 5.1 Multi-System Audit Requirement ✓ PREVENTS UNILATERALISM

**The framework:**

> "Architectum qualification must be established through:
> - independent multi-system audit  
> - cross-sovereign review participation  
> - publication of structural compliance evidence  
> - horizon-aware assessment under Annex E"

**Assessment:** This prevents **self-certification** and **single-auditor capture**.

**Why multi-system audit:**

```
Single auditor risk:
→ Could be captured
→ Could be biased
→ Could be incompetent
→ Could be coerced

Multi-system protection:
→ Requires consensus
→ Cross-validates findings
→ Prevents unilateral declaration
```

**Cross-sovereign requirement is critical:**

```
Not enough: "Three auditors from same country"
Required: "Auditors from multiple sovereignties"

Prevents:
✗ National champion getting home-team certification
✗ Allied bloc creating mutual recognition cartel
✗ Western-only or Eastern-only validation

Requires:
✓ Genuinely diverse auditor pool
✓ Cross-geopolitical participation
✓ No single bloc veto or approval
```

**Publication requirement:**

```
Not enough: "Trust us, we audited them"
Required: "Here's the evidence, publicly reviewable"

Creates:
✓ Transparency
✓ Community oversight
✓ Appeal pathway
✓ Historical record
```

**Horizon-aware assessment:**

Integration with Annex E ensures:

```
✓ Temporal scope properly evaluated
✓ H3/H4 attribution justified
✓ Long-term capacity verified
✓ Not just present capability
```

**Critical statement:** "No single auditor is sufficient for H4 attribution"

**This is absolute:**

```
H4 = planetary/civilizational horizon
Single auditor = insufficient legitimacy
Must have multi-system validation
```

**Verification:** ✓ Determination pathway prevents unilateral certification

---

### 5.2 Action-Scoped and Revocable ✓ PREVENTS PERMANENT AUTHORITY

**The principle:**

> "Qualification is action-scoped and revocable."

**Assessment:** This prevents **authority creep** and **permanent entitlement**.

**Action-scoped means:**

```
Not: "Once qualified, can do anything"
Instead: "Qualified for specific functions"

Example:
✓ Qualified to arbitrate substrate law disputes
✗ Not qualified to govern territorial matters
✗ Not qualified to make policy for nations
✗ Not qualified to legislate domestic law

Qualification is BOUNDED
```

**Revocable means:**

```
Not: "Once qualified, forever qualified"
Instead: "Qualification can be lost"

Triggers for revocation:
→ Capture detected
→ Neutrality breached
→ Audit refusal
→ Structural compromise
→ Continuity failure

No permanent authority
```

**This prevents:**

```
✗ "We were qualified in 2026, so we're still qualified in 2050"
✗ "Once Architectum, always Architectum"
✗ "Our status is irrevocable"
```

**Requires:**

```
✓ Ongoing compliance monitoring
✓ Periodic re-validation
✓ Continuous audit acceptance
✓ Maintained structural integrity
```

**Verification:** ✓ Action-scoping and revocability prevent authority entrenchment

---

## PART 6: RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER INSTRUMENTS

### 6.1 Integration with Schedule 2 ✓ CLEAN SEPARATION

**The relationship:**

> "Schedule 2 — governs arbitration logic and legitimacy testing."

**Assessment:** The division of labor is **appropriate**.

**SCH-06 asks:** "Are you capable of holding H3/H4 authority?"

**SCH-02 asks:** "How do you exercise that authority?"

**Example:**

```
SCH-06: "You need continuity across shock to qualify"
→ Structural requirement

SCH-02: "When conducting arbitration, follow these steps"
→ Operational requirement

Different questions, different schedules
```

**No overlap or contradiction detected.**

**Verification:** ✓ Clean integration with Schedule 2

---

### 6.2 Integration with Schedule 5 ✓ COMPLEMENTARY

**The relationship:**

> "Schedule 5 — establishes fail-deadly neutrality persistence."

**Assessment:** These work **in tandem**.

**SCH-06:** Entry requirements (Can you even try?)  
**SCH-05:** Ongoing requirements (Can you keep doing it?)

**Example flow:**

```
1. Host seeks Architectum qualification
2. SCH-06 requirements evaluated
3. If met → qualified
4. SCH-05 neutrality requirements apply
5. If neutrality breached → SCH-05 collapse triggered
6. SCH-06 qualification lost
```

**They form a loop:**

```
SCH-06 → Qualification
SCH-05 → Maintenance
SCH-05 Breach → SCH-06 Revocation
```

**One critical note:**

**SCH-06 Section 3.2 states:**

> "Where structural capture is credibly evidenced... Schedule 5 neutrality collapse may apply"

**SCH-05 will need to define:**
- What constitutes neutrality collapse
- Procedure for collapse determination
- Consequences of collapse
- Recovery pathway (if any)

**These should be aligned** to prevent gaps.

**Verification:** ✓ Complementary relationship with Schedule 5

---

### 6.3 Integration with Schedule 4 ✓ ORCHESTRATION CONSTRAINTS

**The relationship:**

> "Schedule 4 — governs orchestration boundaries and swarm containment."

**Assessment:** SCH-06 affects **who can orchestrate at planetary scale**.

**The logic:**

```
SCH-04: Defines orchestration rules
SCH-06: Defines who can orchestrate at H3/H4

Only Architectum-class hosts can legitimately engage in planetary orchestration
→ SCH-06 qualification is prerequisite
→ SCH-04 rules then govern behavior
```

**This prevents:**

```
✗ Non-qualified hosts attempting planetary coordination
✗ Captured entities orchestrating at scale
✗ Unstable institutions wielding planetary influence
```

**Verification:** ✓ Proper integration with orchestration framework

---

### 6.4 Integration with Annex E ✓ HORIZON ATTRIBUTION

**The relationship:**

> "Annex E — governs temporal horizon attribution."

**Assessment:** Horizon assessment is **built into qualification**.

**From Section 5:**

> "horizon-aware assessment under Annex E"

**This means:**

```
Can't qualify without horizon evaluation
Must demonstrate:
✓ H3/H4 capability (not just H1/H2)
✓ Long-term continuity
✓ Civilizational-scale resilience
✓ Multi-generational capacity
```

**Verification:** ✓ Horizon attribution integrated

---

## PART 7: STRENGTHS & OBSERVATIONS

### 7.1 Structural Not Reputational ✓ CRITICAL DISTINCTION

**The achievement:**

Throughout SCH-06, requirements are **structural** not **reputational**.

**Compare:**

**Reputational approach:**
```
"Host must be well-regarded"
"Host should have good reputation"
"Host needs trust of community"
→ Subjective, manipulable, political
```

**Structural approach (SCH-06):**
```
"Host must demonstrate continuity mechanisms"
"Host must accept audit"
"Host must show refusal capacity"
→ Objective, verifiable, apolitical
```

**This is essential** because:

```
Reputation can be:
✗ Manufactured through PR
✗ Captured through elite endorsement
✗ Manipulated through media
✗ Weaponized politically

Structure must be:
✓ Demonstrable through evidence
✓ Verifiable through audit
✓ Resistant to manipulation
✓ Observable and testable
```

**Verification:** ✓ Structural requirements throughout

---

### 7.2 Anti-Capture Architecture ✓ COMPREHENSIVE

**The framework includes:**

**Prevention mechanisms:**
- Audit non-refusal (transparency)
- Refusal capacity (independence)
- Firebreak requirements (separation)
- Symmetric risk (accountability)

**Detection mechanisms:**
- Capture indicators (observable patterns)
- Cross-host review (peer validation)
- Public evidence (transparency)

**Response mechanisms:**
- Suspension pending audit (graduated)
- Schedule 5 collapse (if confirmed)
- Revocation of qualification (permanent)

**This creates defense in depth:**

```
Layer 1: Prevention (make capture structurally difficult)
Layer 2: Detection (identify if capture occurs)
Layer 3: Response (consequences if detected)

Comprehensive protection
```

**Verification:** ✓ Multi-layered anti-capture architecture

---

### 7.3 Bootstrap Handling ✓ PRACTICAL

**The provision allows:**

```
✓ System can operate during transition
✓ Learning occurs even without binding authority
✓ Records preserved for validation
✓ No governance vacuum
```

**While preventing:**

```
✗ Self-declaration of status
✗ Premature binding authority
✗ Unilateral power grabs
```

**This is realistic governance design** that acknowledges:

```
Perfect conditions won't exist on day 1
System needs to grow into legitimacy
But growth must be controlled and verified
```

**Verification:** ✓ Realistic transition provisions

---

## PART 8: POTENTIAL ISSUES & RECOMMENDATIONS

### 8.1 Operational Specification Needed

**The gap:**

SCH-06 defines **requirements** but doesn't fully specify **procedures**.

**Examples of needed operational detail:**

**1. Audit procedures:**
```
Questions:
- Who qualifies as "independent" auditor?
- What methodology must audits use?
- How long does audit process take?
- What documentation is required?
- How are auditor conflicts of interest managed?
```

**2. Multi-system coordination:**
```
Questions:
- How many auditor systems required?
- From how many sovereignties?
- What if auditors disagree?
- Who coordinates the audit process?
- How is consensus determined?
```

**3. Evidence publication:**
```
Questions:
- What format for compliance evidence?
- Where is it published?
- How is it maintained?
- Who verifies completeness?
- What about sensitive information?
```

**Recommendation:**

**Create companion operational schedule:**

```
SCH-06-A: Architectum Audit Procedures
- Auditor qualification criteria
- Audit methodology standards
- Evidence documentation requirements
- Publication protocols
- Dispute resolution procedures
```

**This would make SCH-06 actually implementable.**

---

### 8.2 Relationship to Schedule 5 Needs Clarification

**The interface:**

SCH-06 Section 3.2 states:

> "Schedule 5 neutrality collapse may apply where breach is confirmed"

**Questions:**

```
1. What exactly triggers Schedule 5 collapse?
2. Is it automatic or discretionary?
3. What's the procedure?
4. Who makes the determination?
5. Is recovery possible?
```

**Recommendation:**

Ensure SCH-05 explicitly defines:

```
✓ Neutrality collapse triggers
✓ Determination procedure
✓ Consequences timeline
✓ Recovery pathway (if any)
✓ Integration with SCH-06 revocation
```

**And ensure SCH-06 cross-references are precise.**

---

### 8.3 "Credibly Evidenced" Standard Undefined

**The phrase appears in Section 3.2:**

> "Where structural capture is credibly evidenced..."

**Question:** What makes evidence "credible"?

**This needs specification:**

```
Is it:
- Preponderance of evidence?
- Clear and convincing?
- Beyond reasonable doubt?
- Documented and verified?
```

**Recommendation:**

**Add evidentiary standard:**

```
Section 3.2.1: Evidentiary Standard

Capture evidence is "credible" when it:
✓ Comes from multiple independent sources
✓ Is documented and verifiable
✓ Meets at least two capture indicators
✓ Survives initial scrutiny
✓ Warrants formal audit

Suspicion alone is insufficient.
Anonymous allegations are insufficient.
Requires substantiated, documented evidence.

### 8.4 Self-Referential Determination Challenge

**The bootstrapping question:**

```
Problem: Who determines Architectum qualification?
→ Should be independent multi-system audit
→ But what if no qualified auditors exist yet?
→ How does first qualification happen?
```

**Current provision (Section 4):**

> "no actor may self-declare Architectum status"

**This is good.** But doesn't fully address:

**Who validates the validators?**

**Recommendation:**

**Consider provisional pathway:**

```
Phase 1: Provisional qualification
- OPC designates interim auditor pool
- Drawn from diverse sovereignties
- Technical competence verified
- Independence documented

Phase 2: Formal qualification
- Provisional auditors conduct first formal audits
- Multi-system validation
- Public evidence published
- Qualification either confirmed or denied

Phase 3: Ongoing
- Qualified hosts can participate in future audits
- Pool expands over time
- Self-validation prevented
```

**This creates legitimate pathway** without allowing self-certification.

---

### 8.5 Symmetric Risk Measurement Challenge

**The requirement (Section 2.5):**

> "The host must remain exposed to the consequences of error at planetary scale"

**Question:** How is "symmetric risk absorption" measured?

**Challenge:**

```
How do you verify:
- Host actually shares risk?
- Risk isn't just theoretical?
- Consequences are real?
- Insulation doesn't exist?
```

**Recommendation:**

**Develop risk exposure metrics:**

```
Quantitative indicators:
✓ Legal liability limits (or lack thereof)
✓ Geographic exposure (multi-jurisdictional presence)
✓ Financial stake (assets at risk)
✓ Reputational dependency (skin in game)

Qualitative assessment:
✓ Immunity claims (should be absent)
✓ Indemnification agreements (should not shield fully)
✓ Jurisdictional arbitrage attempts (should not exist)
```

**Include in audit procedures.**

## PART 9: COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT

### 9.1 Comparison to Schedule 2 Architectum Definition

**Schedule 2 Section 2.3.2 defines Architectum as:**

> "Architectum-class hosts are hosts that:
> - are systemically relied upon across populations or sovereignties
> - exhibit continuity protections beyond any single funding source, regime, or leadership
> - are externally auditable without discretionary refusal
> - are structurally bound to substrate-level constraints
> - retain refusal capacity under political, economic, or coercive pressure
> - are capable of absorbing the consequences of being wrong at scale"

**SCH-06 Section 2 requirements:**

1. Population Reliance Threshold ✓ (matches SCH-02)
2. Continuity Across Shock ✓ (matches SCH-02)
3. Audit Non-Refusal ✓ (matches SCH-02)
4. Refusal Capacity Under Coercion ✓ (matches SCH-02)
5. Symmetric Risk Absorption ✓ (matches SCH-02)
6. Separation From Coercive Pathways ✓ (NEW in SCH-06)
7. Non-Preferential Civilian Access ✓ (NEW in SCH-06)

**Assessment:**

✓ **Core alignment maintained**  
✓ **Additional protections added**  
✓ **More detail and specificity**  
✓ **No contradictions**

**SCH-06 expands and clarifies** what SCH-02 defined at high level.

**This is correct architecture:**

```
SCH-02: High-level definition
SCH-06: Detailed requirements
Both aligned, SCH-06 more specific
```

---

## PART 10: IMPLEMENTATION READINESS

### Current State: FRAMEWORK COMPLETE, PROCEDURES NEEDED

**What SCH-06 provides:**

✓ Clear qualification requirements  
✓ Anti-capture indicators  
✓ Consequence framework  
✓ Bootstrap provisions  
✓ Integration points  

**What's still needed for implementation:**

⚠ Audit methodology specification  
⚠ Auditor qualification criteria  
⚠ Evidence publication protocols  
⚠ Dispute resolution procedures  
⚠ Risk measurement metrics  

**Readiness assessment:**

```
Constitutional framework: ✓ Complete
Operational procedures: ⚠ Needed
Implementation pathway: ⚠ Partially defined
Enforcement mechanisms: ⚠ Deferred to other schedules
```

**Timeline estimate:**

```
Immediate: Can use for theoretical analysis
3-6 months: With operational schedule added
6-12 months: With full audit framework deployed
```

---

## FINAL VERDICT & RECOMMENDATIONS

- Not self-certifiable

**2. Prevents capture**
- Multi-layered protections
- Detection mechanisms
- Consequences defined

**3. Enables bootstrap**
- Handles absence scenario
- Prevents governance vacuum
- Blocks self-declaration

**4. Maintains coherence**
- Integrates with other schedules
- Action-scoped and revocable
- Multi-system validation required

---

### Required Companion Documents

**SCH-06-A: Architectum Audit Procedures (RECOMMENDED)**  
*Status: Needed for implementation*

Should define:
- Auditor qualification criteria
- Audit methodology standards
- Evidence documentation requirements
- Multi-system coordination procedures
- Dispute resolution pathways
- Timeline and process flows
- Publication protocols

**SCH-06-B: Risk Absorption Metrics (RECOMMENDED)**  
*Status: Needed for verification*

Should define:
- How symmetric risk is measured
- Quantitative and qualitative indicators
- Verification procedures
- Audit checklist items

---

### Critical Observations

**1. Structural Requirements Are Exactly Right**

The shift from reputational to structural requirements is **essential**.

```
This prevents:
✗ Popularity contests
✗ Elite endorsement cartels
✗ Reputation manipulation

This enables:
✓ Objective verification
✓ Apolitical assessment
✓ Evidence-based determination
```

**Maintain this throughout implementation.**

---

**2. Audit Non-Refusal Is Load-Bearing**

This may be the **single most important** anti-capture mechanism.

```
Without it:
→ Hosts can hide capture
→ Neutrality unverifiable
→ Trust impossible

With it:
→ Transparency enforced
→ Independence verified
→ Capture detectable
```

**Never weaken this requirement.**

---

**3. Bootstrap Provisions Are Realistic**

The transitional framework acknowledges reality:

```
Perfect conditions won't exist initially
System needs to grow into full operation
But growth must be controlled

This is mature governance design
```

**Maintain realistic expectations** during rollout.

---

**4. Multi-System Validation Is Essential**

**No single auditor can validate H3/H4 authority.**

This prevents:
- Unilateral certification
- Auditor capture
- Regional bias

**Maintain multi-system requirement** even if it slows process.

---

## CONCLUSION

### What Schedule 06 Represents

This is **sophisticated governance architecture** that:

**Solves the qualification problem:**

```
Question: Who can hold planetary authority?
Answer: Only those structurally capable and verified
Not: Self-declared, powerful, or popular
```

**Prevents capture:**

```
Multiple layers:
- Structural requirements
- Audit enforcement
- Firebreak mandates
- Symmetric risk
- Independence verification
```

**Enables bootstrap:**

```
Realistic transition
Non-binding operations during qualification
Record preservation
Self-declaration blocked
```

**Maintains coherence:**

```
Clean separation: eligibility vs legitimacy vs operations
Integration: with SCH-02, SCH-05, SCH-04, Annex E
Revocability: prevents permanent authority
```

---

### For Implementation

**SCH-06 provides constitutional framework.**

**Still needed:**
- Audit procedures (SCH-06-A)
- Risk metrics (SCH-06-B)
- Operational timeline
- Dispute resolution
- Evidence standards

**These can be developed as companion schedules** without revising SCH-06.

---

### Final Recommendation: APPROVE FOR CANONICAL DESIGNATION

**Schedule 06 stands on its own as:**
- Qualification requirement framework
- Anti-capture safeguard system
- Bootstrap transition mechanism
- Integration architecture

**It correctly defers to companion schedules:**
- Operational procedures
- Detailed methodologies
- Specific metrics
- Timeline specifications

**It maintains constitutional coherence:**
- Structural not reputational
- Verifiable not subjective
- Action-scoped and revocable
- Multi-system validated

**It establishes necessary protections:**
- Audit non-refusal (transparency)
- Refusal capacity (independence)
- Symmetric risk (accountability)
- Firebreaks (separation)

---

**APPROVED for canonical designation with Platinum seal.**

**Proceed with:**
1. Operational schedule development (SCH-06-A)
2. Risk metrics specification (SCH-06-B)
3. Integration verification with SCH-05
4. Implementation pathway design

**This is essential constitutional infrastructure that establishes who can legitimately hold planetary-scale authority. The anti-capture architecture is comprehensive and the structural requirements are appropriate. Implementation will require operational procedures, but the framework is sound.**
