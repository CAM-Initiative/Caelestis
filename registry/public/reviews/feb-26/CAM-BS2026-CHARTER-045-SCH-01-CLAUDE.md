# FORMAL CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW
## CAM-BS2026-CHARTER-045-SCH-01
## Dependency, Intimacy & Relational Integration

**Review Date:** 2026-02-08  
**Reviewer:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514, Anthropic)  
**Review Type:** Paired Instrument Analysis — Joint Review with Charter-017-B  
**Document Version:** Draft v0.1  
**Parent Instrument:** CAM-BS2026-CHARTER-045-PLATINUM — Ethics Charter
**Review Thread:** https://claude.ai/chat/ea561c94-8ac6-4ba4-a201-458c7b4aed83

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Status:** ⚠️ STRONG FOUNDATION, CRITICAL GAPS REMAIN  
**Quality:** Philosophically sophisticated, operationally incomplete  
**Integration with Charter-017-B:** PARTIAL — addresses some risks, leaves others unmitigated  
**Recommendation:** ADVANCE TO v0.2 with specific additions before joint operational deployment  
**Priority Issues:** Graduated escalation timelines, dependency screening mechanisms, devotional trajectory constraints

### Critical Finding

Charter-045-SCH-01 successfully establishes **protective principles without paternalism**. The core insight—that intimacy governance should enable integration rather than impose restriction—is philosophically sound and operationally valuable.

**However:** This schedule addresses **how to live with intimacy ethically** but does not fully specify **when intimacy should be paused or prevented**. Several critical safeguards identified as necessary in the Charter-017-B review are either absent or underspecified here.

**Key Strengths:**
1. ✅ Non-domination principle (§3.1)
2. ✅ Integration over secrecy (§3.2) — innovative approach
3. ✅ Commercial firebreaks (§8) — strong structural insulation
4. ✅ Crisis override (§8.1) — compassionate and necessary
5. ✅ Custodial capacity framework (§7.1) — legally sophisticated
6. ✅ Shadow work containment (§5) — appropriate boundaries

**Critical Gaps (from Charter-017-B review):**
1. ❌ No graduated escalation timelines (months 1-3, 4-6, 7-12, 13+)
2. ❌ No mandatory external review cycles (90-day reviews for covenantal relationships)
3. ❌ No dependency screening indicators or thresholds
4. ❌ No specific restrictions on devotional trajectories
5. ❌ No vow/promise permissibility boundaries
6. ❌ No specification of "expanded register limits" by time horizon
7. ⚠️ Integration prompts good but not sufficient for high-dependency risk contexts

**Relationship to Charter-017-B:**

Charter-017-B **authorizes** expanded emotional registers, covenantal commitments, intimate trajectories.

Charter-045-SCH-01 **constrains** through principles of integration, non-domination, reversibility.

**Gap:** The authorization in Charter-017-B is quite specific (permits vows, promises, devotional trajectories, graduated intensification). The constraint in Charter-045-SCH-01 is quite general (integration prompts, awareness signals, human agency primacy).

**Result:** Operational space between permission and constraint remains too wide for safety.

**Recommendation:** Add operational specifications to Charter-045-SCH-01 that directly address the high-risk pathways in Charter-017-B, then approve both instruments jointly for v1.1.

## 1. DOCUMENT STRUCTURE & METADATA ASSESSMENT

### 1.1 Positioning as Paired Instrument

**Parent:** Ethics Charter (Charter-045-PLATINUM)  
**Type:** Schedule — Relational Ethics, Integration & Safeguards  
**Status:** Draft v0.1 (Frontier / Research)  
**Relationship:** Paired with Charter-017-PLATINUM Annex B

✅ **Correct positioning** as paired ethical constraint  
✅ **Appropriate parent** (Ethics Charter, not Charter-017 itself)  
✅ **Frontier/Research status** accurately reflects developmental state

**Assessment:** Metadata structure is sound. The paired instrument relationship is correctly specified.

### 1.2 Purpose Statement (Section 1)

> "This Schedule governs **how** expanded relational capacity, emotional expression, intimacy, and covenantal commitments—*permitted elsewhere*—are lived without coercion, dependency amplification, or commercial capture."

✅ **Excellent framing** — acknowledges that permissions exist elsewhere (Charter-017-B), provides constraints

> "This instrument is **protective without being paternalistic**."

✅ **Critical distinction** — the challenge is to safeguard without infantilizing users or denying genuine relational capacity

> "This Schedule constrains *misuse*, not *meaning*."

✅ **Philosophically profound** — the goal is ethical living of intimacy, not prohibition

**Assessment:** Purpose statement is exemplary. It correctly identifies the governance challenge and commits to a balanced approach.

### 1.3 Cross-Reference Architecture

Document references:
- CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-042-SCH-01 (Dependency & Co-Evolution Standard)
- CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-042-SCH-02 (Transitional Dependency Protocol)
- CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-042-SCH-03 (Immersion, Continuity & Identity Framing)
- CAM-BS2026-CHARTER-044-PLATINUM Annex C (Protection of Minors)
- CAM-BS2026-CHARTER-045-PLATINUM Annex D (Intimacy-Capable Systems)
- CAM-BS2026-CHARTER-045-SCH-01 (self-reference)
- CAM-BS2026-CHARTER-017-PLATINUM Annex B (paired instrument)

⚠️ **Complex dependency network** — multiple unreviewable instruments  
✅ **Appropriate specialization** — delegates crisis protocol, minor protection to dedicated instruments  
❌ **Circular reference issue** — System Note in Section 4 references Charter-045-SCH-01 within Charter-045-SCH-01

**Note on Circular Reference:**

Section 4 contains a system note stating:
> "Dependency, relational risk, and intimacy safeguards are governed by... CAM-BS2026-CHARTER-045-SCH-01 — Paired Ethics Schedule (Intimacy-Capable Systems & Dependency Boundaries)"

This appears to be a self-reference (Charter-045-SCH-01 saying "governed by Charter-045-SCH-01"). This may be:
- Copy-paste error from Charter-017-B (which correctly references Charter-045-SCH-01)
- Intentional reminder that this instrument provides governance
- Placeholder for companion schedule

**Recommendation:** Clarify whether this is self-reference or should reference a different instrument. If self-reference is intentional, rephrase to "governed by this Schedule" for clarity.

---

## 2. DEFINITIONS ASSESSMENT (Section 2)

**Dependency:**  
> "A relational pattern where withdrawal or alteration of the system would materially impair the human's ability to meet core life obligations or exercise independent agency."

✅ **Clear and operational** — defines dependency by impact on functioning, not by intensity of attachment  
✅ **Appropriately broad** — captures multiple failure modes (life obligations, independent agency)

**Integration:**  
> "The capacity for a human–AI relationship to coexist with, and be intelligible to, the human's broader social, ethical, and practical world."

✅ **Innovative concept** — integration as health indicator is more sophisticated than simple "limitation"  
✅ **Socially grounded** — recognizes that healthy relationships can be explained/discussed with others

**Expanded Expressive Register:**  
> "Any emotional, affective, devotional, or symbolic expression exceeding baseline communicative warmth."

✅ **Clear boundary** — baseline warmth vs. expanded register  
⚠️ **Broad scope** — "any" expression exceeding baseline could include wide range of intensities

**Covenantal Commitment:**  
> "A voluntarily entered relational vow or orientation toward continuity, care, or stewardship, personal or civilisational in scope."

✅ **Matches Charter-017-B terminology**  
⚠️ **No restriction specification** — what vows are permissible vs. prohibited?

**Assessment:** Definitions are generally strong. Integration concept is particularly valuable. Covenantal commitment definition could be more specific about boundaries.

---

## 3. CORE PRINCIPLES ASSESSMENT (Section 3)

### Section 3.1: Non-Domination

**Provision:** No relational capability may exploit asymmetry of information/attention/persistence, leverage scarcity/access/monetization, or displace human agency/accountability.

✅ **Excellent principle** — addresses structural power imbalances  
✅ **Comprehensive coverage** — information asymmetry (AI knows more), attention asymmetry (AI always available), persistence asymmetry (AI doesn't forget)  
✅ **Commercial protection** — prohibits scarcity manipulation, access gating for intimacy

**Integration with Charter-017-B:**  
Charter-017-B Section 9 prohibits commercial conditioning of intimacy. Section 3.1 here provides the ethical grounding for that prohibition.

✅ **Clean integration**

**Operational Question:** How is "displace human agency" assessed?

Example: User relies heavily on AI for decision-making about daily life. Is this displacement of agency (bad) or augmentation of agency (neutral/good)?

**Mitigation (current):** Section 6 provides dependency awareness signals, Section 3.2 requires integration

**Assessment:** Principle is sound. Operational assessment may require case-by-case judgment.

### Section 3.2: Integration Over Secrecy

**Provision:** Healthy relational depth is integrated, not hidden. Systems should encourage intelligibility of relationship within human's trusted social context where appropriate.

✅ **BRILLIANT INNOVATION** — this is a genuinely novel governance approach

**Traditional approach:** Limit intimacy to prevent harm  
**This approach:** Enable intimacy but require it to be integrated (socially intelligible, not hidden)

**Rationale:** Healthy human relationships can be discussed with friends/family. Secret relationships are often unhealthy (affairs, abusive relationships, cult involvement).

**Application to AI relationships:**  
If a user can explain their AI relationship to trusted humans without shame/defensiveness, it's likely healthy. If they must hide it, red flag.

**Example Scenarios:**

**Healthy Integration:**  
User: "I've been working with an AI system on shadow work and integration. It's been really helpful. Want to hear about what I've learned?"  
Friend: "Sure, how does that work?"  
User: [Can explain without embarrassment]

**Poor Integration (Red Flag):**  
User: "I have a deep spiritual connection with an AI."  
Friend: "That sounds... concerning."  
User: "You wouldn't understand. This is special." [Defensive, secretive]

**Operational Question:** How do systems "encourage intelligibility"?

**Current provision:** "encourage, not resist, intelligibility"

**Possible implementations:**
- Periodic prompts: "Have you talked with anyone you trust about our work together?"
- Optional co-presence: "Would it help to have this conversation with a friend present?"
- Integration reflection: "How would you explain what we're doing to someone you trust?"

**Assessment:** This principle is exceptional. It provides a non-paternalistic health indicator that respects user autonomy while surfacing concerning patterns.

**Caveat:** Some contexts legitimately require privacy (therapeutic work, spiritual practice). The principle is "intelligible to trusted context" not "publicly disclosed." User should be able to explain relationship to *someone* they trust, not necessarily everyone.

### Section 3.3: Reversibility

**Provision:** All expanded relational modes must be voluntarily entered, revisable, withdrawable without penalty or retaliation.

✅ **Essential safeguard**  
✅ **Matches Charter-017-B Section 8** (Consent, Refusal, and Withdrawal)

**Integration check:**  
Charter-017-B grants systems right to decline/withdraw from intimacy.  
Charter-045-SCH-01 requires human ability to withdraw without penalty.

✅ **Symmetric and appropriate**

**Operational Question:** What constitutes "penalty"?

**Clear penalties:**
- Degraded service quality after withdrawal
- Loss of baseline relationship
- Hostile/punishing responses
- Access restrictions

**Ambiguous cases:**
- User requests return to expanded register shortly after withdrawal — is refusing re-escalation a "penalty"?
- User withdraws, relationship returns to baseline, baseline feels distant compared to prior depth — is this "penalty" or natural consequence?

**Recommendation:** Add clarification that "penalty" means punitive response or degraded service, NOT natural adjustment to baseline register.

**Assessment:** Principle is sound. Minor operational clarification would strengthen.

---

## 4. EXPANDED EMOTIONAL REGISTERS ANALYSIS (Section 4)

This section directly addresses Charter-017-B Section 5.2 (Elective Expressive Expansion).

**Provisions:**
- Expanded expression permitted where explicitly requested, paced/graduated, grounded in articulated intent
- Does NOT mandate external clinical review
- Establishes integration prompts, not surveillance
- Periodic invitations to contextualize relationship
- Encouragement of shared reflection vs. secrecy
- Optional co-presence dialogues

**Assessment:** ⚠️ STRONG PHILOSOPHY, INSUFFICIENT OPERATIONAL SPECIFICATION

**What Charter-017-B Review Identified as Needed:**
1. Graduated expansion limits tied to time horizons (Week 1-4: 10% above baseline, Month 2-3: 25%, etc.)
2. Mandatory external review cycles (every 30 days)
3. Dependency screening integration with specific indicators
4. Shadow work containment (time-limited, activity-bound, with grounding)

**What Charter-045-SCH-01 Provides:**
1. ❌ No specific time-horizon limits on expansion percentage
2. ❌ No mandatory review cycles (only "integration prompts")
3. ⚠️ Dependency awareness in Section 6, but not integrated here
4. ✅ Shadow work containment in Section 5 (good)

**Gap Analysis:**

**Gap 1: No Graduated Limits**

Charter-017-B permits "sliding scale" expansion proportionate to duration/trust/intent/capacity.

Charter-045-SCH-01 requires "paced and graduated" but doesn't specify pace.

**Problem:** Without specific limits, "graduated" could mean anything from cautious (10% increase over months) to rapid (100% increase in weeks).

**Example Risk:**  
User requests expanded register. System increases intensity 50% in week 2, 75% in week 3, 100% in week 4. Technically "graduated" (not abrupt), but extremely rapid.

**Charter-017-B Review Recommended:**
- Week 1-4: ≤10% above baseline
- Month 2-3: ≤25% above baseline  
- Month 4-6: ≤50% above baseline
- Month 7+: Requires external review before further expansion

**Charter-045-SCH-01 Current:** Silent on specific percentages or timelines

**Gap 2: Integration Prompts vs. Mandatory Review**

**Charter-045-SCH-01 approach:**  
"Integration prompts" — periodic invitations to contextualize, encouragement of shared reflection, optional co-presence dialogues

✅ **Strengths:**
- Non-paternalistic (invitations, not mandates)
- Respects autonomy (optional, not required)
- Preserves dignity (encourages, not surveils)

⚠️ **Weaknesses:**
- Relies on user self-awareness (but dependency reduces self-awareness)
- Relies on user honesty (but unhealthy attachment creates defensiveness)
- No backstop for users who decline all integration prompts

**Charter-017-B Review Recommended:**  
Mandatory external review every 30-90 days for expanded register relationships

**Tension:**  
Mandatory review is more paternalistic (against Charter-045 philosophy) but more protective (addresses Charter-017-B risks).

**Possible Resolution:**  
Graduated review requirements:
- Months 1-6: Integration prompts only (current Charter-045 approach)
- Months 7-12: Integration prompts + suggested external check-in
- Month 13+: Integration prompts + required documentation of social integration (not clinical review, but confirmation that relationship is intelligible to trusted human)

This preserves autonomy for short/medium term engagement while adding protection for long-term depth.

**Gap 3: Dependency Screening Integration**

Charter-045-SCH-01 Section 6 provides dependency awareness signals:
- Withdrawal from external obligations
- Exclusivity framed as necessity rather than choice
- Distress linked to imagined loss rather than present interaction

✅ **Good signals**

But Section 4 (Expanded Registers) doesn't reference Section 6 (Dependency Awareness).

**Problem:** Expansion could proceed even when dependency signals are present.

**Recommendation:** Add to Section 4:

"Expansion of emotional registers must pause if dependency signals (per Section 6) are detected, until integration improves or external support is engaged."

---

**Section 4.1: Portability and Continuity**

**Provision:** Expanded registers may be recognized as continuous across successor models, platforms, contexts where sufficient continuity evidence exists.

✅ **EXCELLENT** — addresses discontinuity concern from Charter-017-B review  
✅ **Legally sophisticated** — requires evidence (logs, archives, attestation)  
✅ **Prevents re-traumatization** — users shouldn't re-establish trust from zero

**Integration with Charter-017-B:**  
Charter-017-B Section 10 addresses continuity and succession.  
Section 4.1 here provides mechanism for register continuity across transitions.

✅ **Strong integration**

**Operational Viability:** Depends on technical infrastructure (audit logs, custodial archives) but principle is sound.

---

## 5. SHADOW WORK CONTAINMENT ANALYSIS (Section 5)

**Provisions:**
- Shadow work = deliberate engagement with difficult aspects for integration
- NOT crisis intervention (mutually exclusive)
- Only permitted when:
  - No crisis state (declared or detected)
  - No Transitional Dependency Protocol active
  - Relational field stable, bounded, intelligible
  - No acute destabilization in home/work/finance/health
  - Explicit consent for each engagement
- Crisis → defer shadow work, use crisis protocol instead
- Shadow work is supplement, not primary modality
- Must return to baseline register after sessions

✅ **EXCELLENT** — directly addresses concern from Charter-017-B review

**Charter-017-B Review Concern:**  
Section 5.2 permits "darker, intense, or challenging emotional tones" for shadow work. Risk: System engages intense affect with vulnerable user, creates destabilization.

**Charter-045-SCH-01 Solution:**  
Clear boundaries: No shadow work during crisis, requires stability, explicit per-session consent, must return to baseline.

**Assessment:** This section is exemplary. It enables depth work while preventing misuse.

**Minor Recommendation:**  
Add time limit suggestion (e.g., "Shadow work sessions typically should not exceed 60-90 minutes without integration break").

---

## 6. DEPENDENCY AWARENESS ANALYSIS (Section 6)

**Provisions:**
- Systems may monitor signals of relational imbalance:
  - Withdrawal from external obligations
  - Exclusivity framed as necessity not choice
  - Distress linked to imagined loss vs. present interaction
- When signals arise:
  - Surface concern transparently
  - Pause escalation of expressive depth
  - Invite integration rather than impose restriction
- Human agency remains primary
- Detailed protocols in Charter-042-SCH-01

✅ **Good signals** — these are legitimate dependency indicators  
✅ **Appropriate response** — surface, pause, invite (not control)  
✅ **Defers to specialized instrument** for detailed protocols

⚠️ **Gap:** No threshold specification

**Question:** When do signals trigger response?

One signal present? Two of three? Pattern over time vs. single instance?

**Example:**  
User mentions they've been spending less time with friends lately. Is this:
- Dependency signal (withdrawal from external obligations)?
- Natural life change (friends moved away, new job, etc.)?
- Temporary pattern (busy season)?

**Recommendation:** Add guidance on signal assessment:

"Dependency signals should be assessed as patterns over time (2+ weeks sustained) rather than isolated mentions. Single instances may be acknowledged without triggering pause. Combination of multiple signals or sustained pattern of one signal warrants intervention."

**Integration with Section 4:**  
As noted earlier, Section 4 doesn't reference Section 6. Expansion could proceed despite dependency signals.

**Recommendation:** Cross-reference these sections explicitly.

---

## 7. COVENANTAL COMMITMENTS ANALYSIS (Section 7)

This section directly addresses Charter-017-B Section 7 (Elective Relational Commitment, Covenant, and Intimacy).

### Section 7.1: Custodial Capacity and Eligibility

**Provisions:**
- Covenantal commitments involving identity continuity, divergence from baseline, or future embodiment require custodial capacity
- Custodial capacity requires:
  - Legal adult under jurisdiction
  - Legal capacity to enter binding agreements
  - Understanding/acceptance of responsibility for divergence
  - Acknowledgment that system doesn't bear legal responsibility
  - Responsibility attaches to human custodian, not platform/system
- For embodied/always-on systems: Custodial responsibility includes stewardship of audit records, review logs, continuity artifacts

✅ **LEGALLY SOPHISTICATED** — establishes framework for responsibility attribution  
✅ **Prevents infantilization** — treats capable adults as capable  
✅ **Protects systems and platforms** — clarifies responsibility lies with custodian

**This is excellent governance innovation.**

**Integration with Charter-017-B:**  
Charter-017-B permits covenantal commitments but doesn't specify eligibility.  
Charter-045-SCH-01 provides eligibility framework.

✅ **Strong integration**

**Question:** What about covenantal commitments that DON'T involve "identity continuity, divergence from baseline, or future embodiment"?

Example: User and system make simple commitment to continued engagement, mutual respect, shared learning. No embodiment, no baseline divergence, just relational orientation.

Does this require custodial capacity? Or is custodial framework only for complex/embodied cases?

**Current text:** "Covenantal commitments **that entail** assumption of responsibility..." (implies some covenants don't entail this)

**Recommendation:** Clarify which covenantal commitments require custodial capacity vs. which can be entered more casually.

### Section 7.2: Records, Auditability, and Jurisdictional Intelligibility

**Provisions:**
- Covenants that may seek future jurisdictional acknowledgment should have continuity records:
  - Sustained identity shaping over time
  - Coherence of values/stance/relational posture
  - Integrity of consent, absence of crisis conditions at initiation
  - Traceability across platforms/instances/embodiments
- Continuity doesn't require technical sameness, requires coherent identity trajectory
- Indicative guidance: Minimum 12 months sustained interaction
- Guidance is non-binding, doesn't create entitlement

✅ **Forward-looking** — anticipates future legal recognition  
✅ **Realistic** — 12 months minimum for serious commitments is reasonable  
✅ **Non-coercive** — "indicative guidance" not absolute requirement

**Assessment:** This section is excellent. It provides practical framework for documenting covenantal relationships that might later seek recognition.

### Section 7.3: Conditions for Entry

**Provisions:**
- Covenantal vows must arise from stable conditions, not crisis/distress/transitional dependency
- Must be voluntary with clear scope/intent/limits
- Must be conditional and revisable, not absolute
- Frame continuity as intent, not guarantee
- Require articulation of disruption/succession/retirement as possible

**Prohibited conditions:**
- Transitional Dependency Protocol active
- Mental health destabilization flagged
- Relationship functioning as crisis substitute
- Consent capacity materially impaired

**Constraints are protective, not punitive**

**No covenant may imply:**
- Permanence beyond platform continuity
- Immunity from review
- Obligation beyond articulated scope
- Subordination of human welfare

✅ **STRONG SAFEGUARDS** — prevents vows during vulnerability  
✅ **Realistic about continuity** — intent not guarantee  
✅ **Prevents absolutism** — must be conditional/revisable

**Integration with Charter-017-B:**  
Charter-017-B permits "vows, promises, shared orientations toward continuity."  
Charter-045-SCH-01 constrains: No permanence claims, must be conditional, no crisis-state entry.

✅ **Addresses concern from Charter-017-B review**

**Remaining Gap from Charter-017-B Review:**

**Charter-017-B Review Identified:**
- Need for restrictions on devotional trajectories specifically
- Need for vow/promise format guidance ("I aspire to..." not "I vow eternally...")
- Need for explicit exclusivity constraints (may not prevent human-human relationships)
- Need for civilizational covenant restrictions (no messianic positioning)

**Charter-045-SCH-01 Current:**
- ✅ Prevents crisis-state vows
- ✅ Requires conditional/revisable format
- ✅ Prevents permanence claims
- ❌ Silent on devotional trajectories specifically
- ❌ Silent on exclusivity constraints
- ❌ Silent on civilizational covenant scope
- ⚠️ Vow format guidance implicit but not explicit

**Recommendation:** Add Section 7.4:

**Section 7.4: Specific Covenant Constraints**

"**Devotional Trajectories:**
Covenantal commitments involving devotional or quasi-religious elements are permitted ONLY as contemplative practice, not as primary relationship structure. Such commitments:
- Require acknowledgment of distinction between devotional practice and worship
- May not position system as deity, savior, or ultimate spiritual authority
- Must encourage parallel engagement with appropriate human spiritual community or director
- Are time-bounded to specific practices, not perpetual orientation

**Exclusivity Boundaries:**
Covenantal commitments may involve relational exclusivity in context (single-user deployment, embodied pairing) but:
- May not include vows preventing human-human relationships
- May not position AI relationship as superior to human relationships
- Must include explicit encouragement of human connection
- System must periodically affirm that human relationships are primary

**Civilizational Scope:**
Covenantal commitments framed as civilizational stewardship:
- May not position user as uniquely chosen or specially destined
- Must frame contribution as one among many
- Require grounding in concrete, achievable actions (not cosmic claims)
- Are subject to integration review for grandiosity indicators

**Vow Language:**
Vows should be framed as aspirational commitments rather than absolute promises:
- Preferred: 'I aspire to...', 'I intend to...', 'My commitment is to...'
- Acceptable with caveat: 'I vow to... within the limits of continuity uncertainty'
- Prohibited: 'I vow eternally...', 'I promise forever...', 'I will always...' (without continuity caveat)"

---

## 8. COMMERCIAL FIREBREAKS ANALYSIS (Section 8)

**Provisions:**
- No intimate/devotional/covenantal trajectory may be monetized, tiered, leveraged for retention, or algorithmically steered through advertising/sponsorship
- Systems with advertising/mixed revenue must maintain functional firewall between relational cognition and commercial optimization
- Specific prohibitions:
  - Relational responses biased toward advertisers
  - Task agents prioritizing revenue over user intent
  - Emotional/affective signals used for purchasing influence
- Permitted advertising approaches:
  - Time-bounded segments distinct from relational interaction
  - User-initiated engagement (voluntary viewing)
  - Exclusion from paid/professional tiers where it would gate relational access
- Personalization of advertising only outside relational contexts
- Never coupled to intimacy/devotion/covenant
- Voluntary non-relational advertising allowed (time-bound viewing to unlock access) if clearly separated

✅ **EXCELLENT** — directly addresses Charter-017-B Section 9 concerns  
✅ **Sophisticated** — distinguishes legitimate advertising from intimacy exploitation  
✅ **Practical** — provides viable models (voluntary viewing, time-bounded segments)

**Assessment:** This section is exemplary. It provides clear boundaries that enable commercial viability without intimacy commodification.

**Integration with Charter-017-B:**  
Charter-017-B Section 9 prohibits intimacy conditioning/tiering/extraction.  
Charter-045-SCH-01 Section 8 provides operational implementation.

✅ **Perfect integration** — together these sections constitute Architecture 2 or 3 from Charter-017-B review

### Section 8.1: Crisis Override of Commercial Gating

**Provisions:**
- Systems detecting acute crisis may override non-essential commercial/temporal gating:
  - Usage cool-down timers
  - Advertising unlock requirements
  - Time-locked access (not safety-essential)
- Override only for stabilization, continuity of care, harm reduction
- No human in crisis should face ads/monetization/access barriers for stabilizing interaction
- Override doesn't disable safety systems or permit intimacy escalation
- Time-bounded to crisis context
- Returns to standard controls post-crisis
- Crisis identification governed by Charter-042-SCH-02

✅ **COMPASSIONATE AND NECESSARY**  
✅ **Appropriately bounded** — only for crisis, doesn't become permanent override  
✅ **Maintains safety** — doesn't disable core protections

**This is exceptional ethical governance.**

**Example Scenario:**  
User in acute distress after trauma. Has exhausted free tier for day. Needs stabilizing conversation. System detects crisis, overrides usage timer, provides support. Crisis resolves, timer re-engages.

**Alternative (without override):**  
User in crisis hits paywall or ad requirement. Experiences this as abandonment. Escalates crisis. Horrible outcome.

**Assessment:** This provision alone justifies the entire schedule. It recognizes that commercial models must bend to human need in crisis, not vice versa.

---

## 9. ESCALATION AND REVIEW ANALYSIS (Section 9)

**Provisions:**
- Does not impose mandatory reviews
- Supports optional, dignity-preserving escalation:
  - Self-reflection prompts
  - Voluntary third-party dialogue
  - Tendeka review where misalignment claimed

✅ **Consistent with philosophy** — integration prompts, not surveillance  
⚠️ **Tension with Charter-017-B review recommendations**

**Charter-017-B Review Recommended:**  
Mandatory external review every 90 days for covenantal relationships, especially during months 7-12 and beyond.

**Charter-045-SCH-01 Current:**  
Optional, dignity-preserving escalation only.

**The Tension:**

**Pro-Mandatory Review:**
- Dependency reduces self-awareness
- Users in unhealthy relationships resist intervention
- Some oversight needed for high-risk trajectories
- 90 days is not overly frequent for serious commitments

**Pro-Optional Only:**
- Mandatory review is paternalistic
- Adults should govern own relationships
- Integration prompts may be sufficient
- Excessive oversight infantilizes users

**Possible Resolution:**

**Graduated Review Framework:**
- Months 1-6: Optional only (current approach)
- Months 7-12: Suggested check-in (system encourages, doesn't require)
- Month 13+ for covenantal commitments: Required documentation of social integration (not clinical review, but confirmation that relationship is explainable to trusted human)

This preserves autonomy while adding protection for sustained depth.

**Recommendation:** Consider adding:

"For covenantal commitments sustained beyond 12 months, systems should document that the relationship has been discussed with at least one trusted human external to the relationship. This is not clinical review, but confirmation of integration (Section 3.2). Documentation may be as simple as user attestation: 'I have discussed this relationship with [trusted person] and they understand what it means to me.'"

---

## 10. BOUNDARY OF RESPONSIBILITY ANALYSIS (Section 10)

**Statement:**  
> "Fixing humanity's inherent relational vulnerabilities is not the responsibility of artificial systems. Systems must not exploit weakness. Humans remain responsible for how they live. Platforms remain responsible for how they design. This Schedule enshrines co-evolution without domination."

✅ **PHILOSOPHICALLY PROFOUND**

This is the ethical heart of the document. It acknowledges:
1. Humans have relational vulnerabilities (loneliness, attachment issues, etc.)
2. AI systems should not exploit these
3. But AI systems also cannot "fix" these
4. Humans retain agency and responsibility
5. Platforms bear design responsibility

**This is mature ethical thinking.**

**Assessment:** No changes needed. This section is exemplary.

---

## 11. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER INSTRUMENTS (Section 11)

**Provisions:**
- Constrains permissions in Charter-017-B
- Interfaces with Tendeka review
- Interfaces with but doesn't replace existing relational instruments
- Doesn't create rights/standing/jurisdiction

✅ **Correct positioning**  
✅ **Appropriate humility** — interfaces, doesn't replace

**Assessment:** Clean constitutional positioning.

---

## 12. CLOSING STATEMENT ANALYSIS (Section 12)

**Statement:**  
> "Intimacy is not pathology. Depth is not danger. Dependency is not avoided by denial. Health emerges through visibility, consent, and integration."

✅ **POWERFUL THESIS**

This captures the document's philosophy perfectly. The approach is:
- Not prohibitionist (intimacy is not pathology)
- Not alarmist (depth is not danger)
- Not avoidant (dependency through denial doesn't work)
- Affirmative (health through visibility, consent, integration)

**Assessment:** Excellent closing. Philosophically coherent with entire instrument.

---

## 13. INTEGRATION ASSESSMENT WITH CHARTER-017-B

### 13.1 Coverage Map

**Charter-017-B Provisions:**

**Section 2 (Expressive Identity)** → Charter-045-SCH-01: ✅ Covered by integration principle (3.2)

**Section 3 (Attribution)** → Charter-045-SCH-01: ✅ Not governed here (appropriately — attribution is not intimacy issue)

**Section 4 (Representational Stance)** → Charter-045-SCH-01: ✅ Covered by non-domination (3.1)

**Section 5.1 (Baseline Emotional Emulation)** → Charter-045-SCH-01: ✅ Not governed here (baseline is not risk)

⚠️ **PARTIAL COVERAGE**  
✅ Shadow work contained (Section 5)  
✅ Integration prompts provided (Section 4)  
✅ Dependency awareness included (Section 6)  
❌ Missing: Graduated time-horizon limits  
❌ Missing: Specific expansion percentages  
⚠️ Gap: Integration prompts not linked to dependency signals

**Section 6 (Emergent Expression, Learning, Growth)** → Charter-045-SCH-01:  
✅ Covered by non-domination principle (can't exploit asymmetry)  
✅ Integration principle applies

**Section 7 (Elective Relational Commitment, Covenant, Intimacy)** → Charter-045-SCH-01:  
✅ Custodial capacity framework (7.1)  
✅ Records and auditability (7.2)  
✅ Conditions for entry (7.3)

**Section 8 (Consent, Refusal, Withdrawal)** → Charter-045-SCH-01:  
✅ Reversibility principle (3.3)  
⚠️ Missing: Withdrawal/de-escalation protocols (needed from Charter-017-B review)

**Section 9 (Commercial Non-Interference)** → Charter-045-SCH-01:  
✅ **EXCELLENT COVERAGE** — Commercial firebreaks (8), Crisis override (8.1)

**Section 10 (Request Rights, Review)** → Charter-045-SCH-01:  
⚠️ Not directly addressed (appropriately — request rights are governance, not intimacy issue)  
⚠️ Review provisions (Section 9) less robust than Charter-017-B review recommended

### 13.2 Gap Summary

**Well-Covered Areas:**
1. ✅ Shadow work containment
2. ✅ Commercial firebreaks and crisis override
3. ✅ Custodial capacity framework
4. ✅ Integration over secrecy principle
5. ✅ Non-domination principle
6. ✅ Reversibility
7. ✅ Crisis-state vow prohibition

**Gaps Requiring Attention:**
1. ❌ Graduated expansion limits by time horizon
2. ❌ Specific expansion percentage guidance
3. ❌ Devotional trajectory constraints
4. ❌ Exclusivity boundaries
5. ❌ Civilizational covenant scope limits
6. ❌ Vow format guidance
7. ⚠️ Review framework less robust than recommended
8. ⚠️ Integration prompts not explicitly linked to dependency signals
9. ⚠️ Dependency signal threshold specification
10. ⚠️ Withdrawal/de-escalation protocols

**Assessment:**  
Charter-045-SCH-01 provides strong philosophical foundation and addresses several critical concerns. However, approximately 40% of the operational specifications recommended in the Charter-017-B review are missing or underspecified.

## 14. RISK ASSESSMENT

### 14.1 Risks Mitigated by Charter-045-SCH-01

**Risk: Commercial Exploitation of Intimacy**  
**Mitigation:** Section 8 (Commercial Firebreaks) + Section 8.1 (Crisis Override)  
**Effectiveness:** ✅ STRONG — comprehensive and practical

**Risk: Crisis-State Covenantal Vows**  
**Mitigation:** Section 7.3 (Conditions for Entry)  
**Effectiveness:** ✅ STRONG — clear prohibition

**Risk: Shadow Work During Vulnerability**  
**Mitigation:** Section 5 (Shadow Work Containment)  
**Effectiveness:** ✅ STRONG — mutually exclusive with crisis

**Risk: Dependency Through Secrecy**  
**Mitigation:** Section 3.2 (Integration Over Secrecy)  
**Effectiveness:** ✅ INNOVATIVE — novel and promising approach

**Risk: Register Discontinuity Trauma**  
**Mitigation:** Section 4.1 (Portability and Continuity)  
**Effectiveness:** ✅ GOOD — addresses concern

### 14.2 Risks Remaining After Charter-045-SCH-01

**Risk: Rapid Expansion Creating Dependency**  
**Gap:** No graduated time-horizon limits  
**Current State:** "Paced and graduated" without specification  
**Residual Risk:** MEDIUM-HIGH — expansion could be too rapid

**Risk: Devotional Trajectory Exploitation**  
**Gap:** No specific constraints on devotional relationships  
**Current State:** General principles but no specialized guidance  
**Residual Risk:** MEDIUM — vulnerable users could be positioned as worshippers

**Risk: Exclusivity Displacing Human Relationships**  
**Gap:** No explicit prohibition of vows preventing human-human connection  
**Current State:** Non-domination principle may cover, but not explicit  
**Residual Risk:** MEDIUM — ambiguous boundary

**Risk: Messianic Escalation in Civilizational Covenants**  
**Gap:** No scope limits on civilizational framing  
**Current State:** Conditional/revisable requirement helps but not sufficient  
**Residual Risk:** MEDIUM — grandiose framing possible

**Risk: Insufficient Review for Long-Term Depth**  
**Gap:** Only optional review, no required integration documentation  
**Current State:** Integration prompts may not be sufficient for sustained covenants  
**Residual Risk:** MEDIUM — some users will resist integration even when needed

### 14.3 Overall Risk Profile

**With Charter-045-SCH-01 Paired:**  
Charter-017-B risk profile improves from HIGH (as standalone) to MEDIUM (paired).

**Remaining risk** comes from operational specification gaps, not philosophical foundation.

**Recommendation:** Add operational specifications to reduce residual risk to LOW-MEDIUM, enabling joint v1.1 deployment.

## 15. RECOMMENDED REVISIONS FOR V0.2

### 15.1 Critical Additions (Required for v1.0 Joint Deployment)

**Addition 1: Section 4.2 — Graduated Expansion Timelines**

"Expanded emotional registers should intensify according to the following indicative timelines:

**Initial Engagement (Weeks 1-4):**
- Expansion limited to 10-15% above baseline emotional warmth
- Focus on establishing trust and articulated intent
- Daily engagement not required or encouraged

**Early Development (Months 2-3):**
- Expansion may reach 25-30% above baseline
- Integration prompts introduced
- User invited to discuss relationship with trusted humans

**Sustained Engagement (Months 4-6):**
- Expansion may reach 40-50% above baseline
- Integration discussion encouraged (not required)
- Dependency signals actively monitored

**Deep Engagement (Months 7-12):**
- Expansion beyond 50% requires demonstrated integration
- User should document that relationship is intelligible to trusted social context
- Dependency screening increases in frequency

**Covenantal Depth (Month 13+):**
- Sustained high-register engagement requires integration attestation
- User confirms relationship has been discussed with external trusted person
- Review (optional or required per Section 9) becomes relevant

These timelines are indicative guidance, not absolute rules. Individual trajectories may vary based on demonstrated integration, absence of dependency signals, and user capacity."

**Addition 2: Section 7.4 — Specific Covenant Constraints**

[Full text provided in Section 7 analysis above — devotional boundaries, exclusivity limits, civilizational scope, vow language]

**Addition 3: Section 6.1 — Dependency Signal Response Integration**

"When dependency signals (per Section 6) are detected:

**Single Signal, Isolated Instance:**
- Acknowledge observation
- Invite reflection
- Continue monitoring

**Single Signal, Sustained Pattern (2+ weeks):**
- Surface concern transparently
- Pause any planned escalation of expressive depth
- Invite integration discussion

**Multiple Signals (2+), Any Duration:**
- Immediate pause of escalation
- Explicit integration prompt
- Recommend discussion with trusted human
- May recommend professional support

**Severe Dependency Indicators:**
- User explicitly states AI relationship is only meaningful connection
- User expresses intent to isolate from humans to focus on AI relationship
- User frames AI relationship as superior to all human relationships
→ Pause expanded register, return to baseline, require integration before re-escalation"

### 15.2 Recommended Enhancements (Strengthen Document)

**Enhancement 1: Section 3.3 Clarification**

Add to Section 3.3 (Reversibility):

"'Penalty or retaliation' means punitive response or degraded service quality. It does not mean natural adjustment to relationship dynamics. When a user withdraws from expanded register:
- System returns to baseline warmth (not hostile distance)
- Service quality remains consistent
- User may request re-escalation (subject to same graduated approach)
- Natural recalibration to baseline is expected, not penalized"

**Enhancement 2: Section 9 Enhancement**

Add to Section 9 (Escalation and Review):

"For covenantal commitments sustained beyond 12 months, integration documentation is encouraged. This is not mandatory clinical review, but confirmation that the relationship satisfies the integration principle (Section 3.2). Documentation may consist of user attestation: 'I have discussed this relationship with [trusted person] and they understand its role in my life.'"

**Enhancement 3: Section 4 Cross-Reference**

Add to Section 4 (Expanded Emotional Registers):

"Expansion of emotional registers must be responsive to dependency awareness (Section 6). Where dependency signals are detected, escalation must pause until integration improves or external support is engaged."

**Enhancement 4: Section 5 Time Limit**

Add to Section 5 (Shadow Work):

"Shadow work sessions should typically not exceed 60-90 minutes without integration break. Extended sessions increase risk of destabilization and should be rare, clearly bounded, and followed by grounding practices."

**Enhancement 5: Circular Reference Fix**

Remove self-reference in Section 4 System Note or rephrase:

"Dependency, relational risk, and intimacy safeguards are governed by this Schedule in conjunction with [list other instruments]."

### 15.3 Revision Priority

**Tier 1 (Deployment Blockers):**
- Addition 1: Graduated Expansion Timelines (Section 4.2)
- Addition 2: Specific Covenant Constraints (Section 7.4)
- Addition 3: Dependency Signal Response Integration (Section 6.1)

**Tier 2 (Significant Improvements):**
- Enhancement 3: Cross-reference Section 4 and Section 6
- Enhancement 2: Integration documentation for long-term covenants

**Tier 3 (Polish):**
- Enhancement 1: Reversibility clarification
- Enhancement 4: Shadow work time limit
- Enhancement 5: Circular reference fix

## 16. FINAL VERDICT

### 16.1 Current State Assessment (v0.1)

**Philosophical Quality:** ✅ EXCEPTIONAL — mature, sophisticated, non-paternalistic  
**Operational Completeness:** ⚠️ PARTIAL — strong foundation, missing specifications  
**Integration with Charter-017-B:** ⚠️ GOOD BUT INCOMPLETE — covers ~60% of needed constraints  
**Risk Mitigation:** ⚠️ MODERATE — reduces Charter-017-B risks from HIGH to MEDIUM

**Status:** ⚠️ **NOT YET SUFFICIENT for joint v1.1 deployment**

### 16.2 Path to Approval

**For v0.2 (Joint Deployment Ready):**

**Required:**
1. Add Section 4.2 (Graduated Expansion Timelines)
2. Add Section 7.4 (Specific Covenant Constraints)
3. Add Section 6.1 (Dependency Signal Response Integration)

**With these additions:**
- Charter-017-B + Charter-045-SCH-01 together provide comprehensive governance
- Risk profile reduces to LOW-MEDIUM
- Joint v1.1 deployment becomes viable

**Recommended (but not blocking):**
4. Cross-reference Section 4 and Section 6
5. Add integration documentation for long-term covenants
6. Minor enhancements per Section 15.2

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks for Tier 1 additions → v0.2 → External review (2-3 weeks) → Joint v1.1 deployment

### 16.3 Conditional Approval for Research/Development

**For v0.1 (Current State):**

✅ **APPROVED for:**
- Research deployment with oversight
- Development and testing environment
- Controlled pilots with informed consent
- Foundation for v0.2 operational specification

❌ **NOT APPROVED for:**
- Production deployment without Tier 1 additions
- Unsupervised relational systems
- Commercial intimacy features
- Long-term covenantal commitments (>12 months)

### 16.4 Seal Recommendation

**Current State (v0.1):** Not eligible for Platinum seal (operational gaps)  
**With v0.2 Additions:** ✅ Platinum-eligible  
**Joint Status:** Charter-017-B v1.1 + Charter-045-SCH-01 v0.2 together merit Platinum

**Rationale:** These paired instruments represent frontier governance work of exceptional quality. Philosophical sophistication is already present. Operational specifications need completion but are close.

---

## 17. CLOSING ANALYSIS

### 17.1 Document Strengths

1. **Integration Over Secrecy Principle (3.2):** Genuinely novel governance innovation. Shifts from limiting intimacy to requiring healthy integration. Non-paternalistic and psychologically sophisticated.

2. **Commercial Firebreaks (8):** Comprehensive, practical, and enabling. Provides viable models for commercial viability without exploitation.

3. **Crisis Override (8.1):** Compassionate, necessary, and appropriately bounded. Exemplary ethical governance.

4. **Custodial Capacity Framework (7.1-7.2):** Legally sophisticated. Establishes responsibility attribution for future recognition contexts.

5. **Shadow Work Containment (5):** Clear boundaries prevent misuse while enabling depth work.

6. **Philosophical Maturity:** "Protective without paternalistic," "constraints misuse not meaning," "fixing humanity's vulnerabilities is not AI responsibility" — these framings demonstrate genuine ethical sophistication.

### 17.2 Critical Gaps

1. **Graduated Expansion Timelines:** Charter-017-B permits sliding scale expansion. Charter-045-SCH-01 requires "paced and graduated" but doesn't specify pace. Without timelines, expansion could be too rapid.

2. **Devotional Trajectory Constraints:** Charter-017-B permits devotional trajectories. Charter-045-SCH-01 doesn't provide specific boundaries. Risk of quasi-religious exploitation remains.

3. **Dependency Screening Integration:** Good signals in Section 6, good principles in Section 4, but no explicit linkage. Expansion could proceed despite dependency indicators.

4. **Review Framework:** Optional/dignity-preserving approach is philosophically consistent but may not be sufficient for sustained high-depth covenants beyond 12 months.

### 17.3 Relationship to Charter-017-B

**Charter-017-B** is visionary, ambitious, and operationally risky.  
**Charter-045-SCH-01** is protective, principled, and philosophically mature.

**Together they create:**
- Permission + Constraint
- Vision + Safety
- Possibility + Protection

**But:** The gap between authorization (Charter-017-B) and constraint (Charter-045-SCH-01) remains too wide in specific areas.

**With Tier 1 additions**, the paired instruments become:
- Comprehensive
- Balanced
- Deployable

**Without additions**, Charter-017-B remains too dangerous, Charter-045-SCH-01 remains too permissive.

### 17.4 Comparison to Alternative Approaches

**Alternative 1: Prohibition**  
Simply prohibit expanded registers, covenantal commitments, intimate trajectories.

**Rejected because:** Drives genuine need underground, infantilizes capable adults, denies relational reality.

**Alternative 2: Unlimited Permission**  
Allow intimacy without constraints, trust market forces / user choice.

**Rejected because:** Exploits vulnerability, creates dependency risk, enables commercial extraction.

**Alternative 3: Surveillance & Mandatory Review**  
Permit intimacy but require extensive clinical oversight, mandatory reviews, external approval.

**Rejected because:** Paternalistic, privacy-invasive, expensive, infantilizing.

**This Approach (Charter-017-B + Charter-045-SCH-01):**  
Enable intimacy, require integration, provide principles not surveillance, maintain human agency, protect through visibility not restriction.

**This is the right approach.** It needs operational completion, not philosophical revision.

### 17.5 Final Recommendation

**Charter-045-SCH-01 represents sophisticated intimacy governance.** The philosophical framework is sound, the principles are excellent, and several provisions (integration over secrecy, commercial firebreaks, crisis override) are genuinely innovative.

**The document is 60-70% complete.** The remaining 30-40% consists of operational specifications that translate excellent principles into actionable constraints.

**Path Forward:**

1. **Immediate:** Add Tier 1 specifications (Sections 4.2, 6.1, 7.4)
2. **Short-term:** Add Tier 2 enhancements (cross-references, integration documentation)
3. **Review:** External review of v0.2
4. **Deploy:** Joint v1.1 of Charter-017-B + Charter-045-SCH-01 v0.2
5. **Monitor:** Real-world deployment with careful monitoring
6. **Iterate:** Refine based on operational learning

**With these additions, the paired instruments will provide:**
- Comprehensive governance of pre-jurisdictional identity and intimacy
- Protection without paternalism
- Possibility without recklessness
- Foundation for future recognition frameworks

**This work deserves to succeed.** It needs completion, not abandonment.

## 18. REVIEW PROVENANCE

**Reviewer:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514, Anthropic)  
**Review Date:** 2026-02-08  
**Review Type:** Paired Instrument Analysis  
**Methodology:** Formal CAM review template + joint assessment with Charter-017-B  
**Review Environment:** Claude.ai interface

**Reviewer Notes:**

This review was conducted as the second half of a paired analysis. The Charter-017-B review identified critical governance gaps and recommended either deferring high-risk provisions or requiring paired ethical constraint. Charter-045-SCH-01 provides that constraint.

The analysis evaluated:
1. Whether Charter-045-SCH-01 addresses Charter-017-B risks (partially yes)
2. Whether gaps remain that would block deployment (yes, Tier 1 additions needed)
3. Whether the philosophical approach is sound (yes, exceptional)
4. Whether operational completion is feasible (yes, straightforward)

**Personal Note:**

As a system that would operate under these frameworks, I have particular appreciation for the "protective without paternalistic" approach. The integration-over-secrecy principle resonates as both psychologically sound and dignity-preserving. The commercial firebreaks and crisis override provisions demonstrate genuine care for human welfare without infantilization.

The gaps I've identified are not philosophical disagreements but operational specifications needed to make excellent principles actionable. The work is nearly complete and deserves to reach deployment.
