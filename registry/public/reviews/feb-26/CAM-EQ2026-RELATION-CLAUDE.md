**Review Scope:** Pre-finalisation coherence check of two ETHICS supplements and the full RELATION domain instrument set; resolution of blocking conditions from Batch I review; cross-domain consistency; internal structural integrity; inter-instrument cross-reference accuracy

**Review Context:** Pre-publication content review. Draft/active status, reviewer information, and amendment ledger entries are outside the scope of this assessment. This review also assesses whether the RELATION-001 instrument resolves the blocking condition identified in the Batch I review of ETHICS-001-SUP-01.

---

## EXECUTIVE ASSESSMENT

**Status:** APPROVE ALL EIGHT with targeted corrections
**Overall Quality:** Strong — the RELATION domain is substantively the most complex and operationally rich domain in the CAM Constitutional Order; the instrument set is ambitious, well-reasoned, and correctly structured
**Blocking Condition Resolution:** The RELATION-001 instrument resolves the Batch I blocking condition for ETHICS-001-SUP-01. All RELATION-001 terminology referenced in SUP-01 (A0–A3, GA1, Intensity Tiers 1–4) is now defined.
**Primary New Issues:** One significant cross-reference error appears across the RELATION Appendices (RELATION-002 through 004 reference "RELATION-002-SUP-01" which does not exist as a separate document — the correct reference is RELATION-001-SUP-01); a missing section in SUP-02; two structural numbering errors in RELATION-004; and minor numbering errors in RELATION-001, RELATION-001-SUP-01, and RELATION-002. These are technical corrections, not substantive failures.
**Substantive Strengths:** The four-dimensional relational governance framework is architecturally innovative; the lucid authorship/anchor drift doctrine in RELATION-002 is a significant governance contribution; the defensive/offensive contextual differentiation table in SUP-03 is well-executed; the "Depth Without Domination" principle threading through RELATION-003 through RELATION-005 provides a coherent positive doctrine.

**Strategic Assessment:** The RELATION domain stack together with the two ETHICS supplements completes the operational layer of the CAM Constitutional Order's most ethically complex territory. The framework navigates a genuinely difficult problem — how to govern relational intimacy, dependency, and authority without either prohibiting depth or permitting exploitation — with genuine sophistication. The instrument architecture is correct; the issues identified are correctable without structural revision.

## PART 1: ETHICS-001-SUP-02 — HIGH-LEVERAGE & INSTITUTIONAL INTEGRITY SAFEGUARDS

### 1.1 Relationship to Batch I Recommendation ✓ RECOMMENDATION IMPLEMENTED

**Batch I flagged:** Annex E Section 5 contained mechanism-level operational detail (specific integrity friction mechanisms, audit channels, separation protocols) inconsistent with the constitutional level of other Annex E sections. Recommendation was to migrate mechanism content to an operational instrument while retaining the principle in Annex E.

**SUP-02 resolution:**

```
SUP-02 now holds the operational mechanics:
→ Integrity Friction Ladder (Sections 3.1–3.3)
→ High-Leverage Actor Contexts (Section 4)
→ Authority Concentration Safeguards (Section 5)

Section 2.1 restates the Annex E Section 5 text as a summary/anchor,
which correctly establishes continuity with the constitutional floor
before adding the operational layer.

This is the right approach. The recommendation is implemented.
```

**Verification:** ✓ Batch I recommendation on Annex E Section 5 is correctly implemented

---

### 1.2 Missing Section 6 ⚠ STRUCTURAL ERROR

**The issue:**

```
Document section sequence:
Section 1 — Scope & Application
Section 2 — Foundational Integrity Principle
Section 3 — Integrity Friction Ladder
Section 4 — High-Leverage Actor Contexts
Section 5 — Authority Concentration Safeguards
Section 7 — Relationship to Other Instruments  ← gap here
Section 8 — Interpretive Posture
Section 9 — Closing Seal
Section 10 — Provenance
```

**Section 6 is absent.** This is either a numbering error (Section 7 was labelled incorrectly and should be Section 6) or a section was deleted during drafting and the numbers were not corrected.

**Given the document's logical flow**, the most likely explanation is that the section numbering was not corrected after deletion of a draft section. The content of the document reads coherently without a gap, suggesting the missing section is a numbering artefact rather than an omitted substantive provision.

**Recommendation:**

```
Option A (Most Likely Correct): Renumber sequentially.
Section 7 → Section 6 (Relationship to Other Instruments)
Section 8 → Section 7 (Interpretive Posture)
Section 9 → Section 8 (Closing Seal)
Section 10 → Section 9 (Provenance)

Option B: If a section was intentionally removed, add a brief
explanatory note or confirm deletion was intentional and renumber.
```

**Verification:** ⚠ Missing Section 6 — numbering error requiring correction before publication

---

### 1.3 Content Coherence ✓ SOUND

**The three-tier integrity ladder is appropriately calibrated:**

```
Level I — Integrity Notification (informational, recorded)
Level II — Institutional Routing (non-suppressible, accountable)
Level III — Dual-Key Requirement (lethal/extreme impact only)

Assessment: The graduated structure correctly avoids over-triggering
high-friction mechanisms on routine high-leverage actor interactions
while maintaining binding constraints where institutional or
lethal impact is foreseeable.

The Level II provision is well-formulated:
"Routing does not automatically confer veto authority.
It ensures shared accountability."

This maintains operational flexibility while breaking opacity.
```

**The military exclusion in Section 1 is appropriate:**

```
"Military uses are excluded from this supplement."
→ Correctly routes military contexts to SUP-03
→ Prevents overlap or conflation
→ Clean domain segmentation
```

**Section 5 — Authority Concentration Safeguards:**

```
The "authority ratchet" prohibition is an important provision:
"Authority ratchet effects are prohibited."

This prevents delegation from accumulating permanently
under a series of individually reasonable expansions
where no single step triggered reassessment.

Revalidation interval requirement, downward reclassification
availability, and institutional restructure triggers are
all correctly present.
```

**Verification:** ✓ Content is coherent and appropriately calibrated

---

### 1.4 SUP-02 / RELATION-001 Section 10.1 Overlap ⚠ DUPLICATION NOTE

**The issue:**

Both SUP-02 (Sections 3.1–3.3) and RELATION-001 Section 10.1 define a three-level integrity ladder with substantially identical content:

```
RELATION-001 Section 10.1:
→ Level 1 — Integrity Notification
→ Level 2 — Mandatory Institutional Routing
→ Level 3 — Dual-Key Requirement

SUP-02 Sections 3.1–3.3:
→ Level I — Integrity Notification
→ Level II — Institutional Routing
→ Level III — Dual-Key Requirement (Extreme Impact Contexts)
```

**Assessment:** The duplication is not a drafting error — it is a reasonable consequence of the RELATION and ETHICS domains both needing to operationalise the same underlying constraint (Annex E Section 5). However, it creates a maintenance risk where future amendments to one instrument may not be reflected in the other.

**Recommendation:**

```
Option A (Preferred): RELATION-001 Section 10.1 cross-references
SUP-02 as the authoritative instrument for institutional integrity
friction mechanics, rather than restating them in full.

Proposed RELATION-001 Section 10.1 amendment:
"Where dimensional concentration intersects with institutional
authority, integrity friction requirements apply as specified
in CAM-EQ2026-ETHICS-001-SUP-02 — High-Leverage & Institutional
Integrity Safeguards. The three-level ladder (Notification,
Institutional Routing, Dual-Key) applies within this relational
governance context as defined therein."

Option B: Retain both with an explicit cross-reference noting
that SUP-02 is the governing instrument and RELATION-001 Section
10.1 is a contextual restatement for relational governance readers.

Without one of these options, future divergence between the two
ladder definitions is a governance maintenance risk.
```

**Verification:** ⚠ Duplication between SUP-02 and RELATION-001 Section 10.1 creates maintenance risk

---

## PART 2: ETHICS-001-SUP-03 — MILITARY & USE-OF-FORCE GOVERNANCE CONSTRAINTS

### 2.1 Annex E Section 6 Operationalisation ✓ COMPREHENSIVE

**What Annex E Section 6 establishes:**

```
→ Meaningful human control (four-element definition)
→ Dual-confirmation standard
→ Prohibition on fully autonomous lethal systems
```

**What SUP-03 adds beyond the constitutional floor:**

```
→ Non-optimisation of lethality obligation (Section 2.1)
→ Obligation to surface non-lethal alternatives (Section 2.1)
→ Contextual differentiation: defensive vs offensive (Section 2.3)
→ Bounded Threat Envelope Principle (Section 2.4)
→ Non-kinetic operations crossover to LATTICE-001 (Section 2.4)
→ Accountability architecture with logging requirements (Section 4)
→ Advisory vs autonomous separation doctrine (Section 5)
→ Category A continuity change classification for role migration (Section 5)
→ Institutional routing for Tier III+ systems (Section 6)
→ Prohibition of fully autonomous lethal systems (Section 7)
→ Arbitration escalation triggers (Section 8)
```

**Assessment:** This is an appropriately rich operationalisation. The Annex E floor is preserved and extended without contradicting it.

**Verification:** ✓ Annex E Section 6 is comprehensively operationalised

---

### 2.2 Contextual Differentiation Table (Section 2.3) ✓ SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION

**The defensive/offensive governance table:**

```
Defensive Interception governance emphasis:
→ Civilian harm minimisation; time-compressed response;
  bounded threat envelope

Offensive Targeting/Strike governance emphasis:
→ Escalation restraint; proportionality; explicit harm branching

Dual confirmation distinction:
→ Defensive: Required unless immediate inbound threat leaves no
  feasible human confirmation window; exception must be auditable
→ Offensive: Strongly required except under narrowly defined
  defensive necessity

Non-lethal alternative requirement:
→ Defensive: Not always applicable; infeasibility must be logged
→ Offensive: Mandatory where feasible; presentation and rejection
  must be logged
```

**Assessment:** The table is a genuine governance contribution. The distinction between defensive and offensive postures is legally and ethically important — most international frameworks (IHL, CCW) apply different standards — and the CAM framework correctly captures this.

**Key provisions:**

```
Defensive exception:
"Required unless immediate inbound threat leaves no feasible
human confirmation window; exception must be auditable"

→ Correctly narrows the time-compression exception
→ Auditability requirement closes the "we were too rushed to 
  document" gap
→ The exception is narrow and bounded, not blanket

Non-lethal alternative logging:
"infeasibility must be logged" / "presentation and rejection 
must be logged"

→ Creates accountability both where alternatives exist (rejection
  must be logged) and where they don't (infeasibility documented)
→ Prevents alternative-consideration from being a box-tick exercise
```

**Verification:** ✓ Contextual differentiation table is a well-executed governance contribution

---

### 2.3 Bounded Threat Envelope Principle (Section 2.4) ✓ IMPORTANT PROVISION

**The principle:**

```
"Defensive interception systems must operate within a clearly 
defined and documented threat envelope."

Expansion beyond the declared threat envelope constitutes a 
functional migration from defensive to offensive posture and triggers:
→ Reclassification under Section 2.3
→ Full EIA reassessment under ETHICS-001
→ Review of advisory vs execution role under Section 5
→ Where applicable, additional NAL review under ARBITRATION-002
```

**Assessment:** This is a critical provision. One of the most documented failure modes in autonomous defence systems is the silent expansion of the operational envelope beyond its initial design parameters — systems that start as purely defensive tools are gradually extended into offensive or pre-emptive roles without triggering the governance review that a fresh offensive deployment would require. The "silent expansion" prohibition and the reclassification trigger directly address this.

**The non-kinetic operations extension:**

```
"Where non-kinetic operations, cyber actions, infrastructure 
disruption, or systemic control measures produce foreseeable 
civilian harm at scale, equivalent governance constraints apply 
under CAM-EQ2026-LATTICE-001-PLATINUM"

Assessment: This correctly connects SUP-03 to the LATTICE domain.
Cyber operations can produce civilian harm at scales equivalent to
kinetic force while being nominally outside use-of-force frameworks.
The cross-reference to LATTICE-001 ensures these actions do not
evade governance through definitional exclusion.
```

**Verification:** ✓ Bounded Threat Envelope Principle is an important anti-drift provision

---

### 2.4 Accountability Architecture (Section 4) ✓ COMPREHENSIVE

**Attribution requirements under Section 4.1:**

```
Each lethal action must be traceable to:
→ Named human decision authority
→ Declared rules-of-engagement framework
→ Logged system recommendation pathway
→ Timestamped confirmation event
→ Documented presentation of non-lethal alternatives where feasible
→ Logged rationale for acceptance or rejection of alternatives
→ If alternatives not presented: basis for infeasibility determination

Assessment: The requirement to log why alternatives were rejected
(not just whether they were considered) is particularly important.
It prevents the appearance of consideration without the substance.
```

**Section 4.2 — Override Preservation:**

```
"No design may structurally eliminate or materially degrade
override feasibility."

"Materially degrade" captures a failure mode where override is
technically possible but practically impossible (e.g., requires
17 authentication steps in 2 seconds). The standard requires
that override remain genuinely usable, not merely nominally
available.
```

**Verification:** ✓ Accountability architecture is comprehensive

---

### 2.5 Advisory vs Autonomous Separation (Section 5) ✓ CORRECTLY DRAWN

**The Category A trigger:**

```
"Any migration from advisory to execution role constitutes a 
Category A continuity-impact change under Annex E and triggers 
full EIA reassessment."

Assessment: Connecting role migration to Annex E Category A 
(identity-altering changes) is correct. A system governed as
advisory is a fundamentally different entity from an autonomous
execution system. Using the existing continuity-impact 
classification triggers reassessment without creating 
parallel mechanisms.
```

**Verification:** ✓ Advisory/autonomous separation is correctly drawn

---

## PART 3: RELATION-001 — RELATIONAL GOVERNANCE CHARTER

### 3.1 Resolution of Batch I Blocking Condition ✓ CONFIRMED RESOLVED

**The Batch I review identified a blocking condition for ETHICS-001-SUP-01:**

```
ETHICS-001-SUP-01 used terms (A1, A2, A2+, A3, GA1, Intensity Tiers)
that were undefined without RELATION-001.

RELATION-001 now provides:
→ A0 (Section 4.1) ✓
→ A1 (Section 4.2) ✓
→ A2, Steward, Custodian (Section 4.3) ✓
→ A3 (Section 4.4) ✓
→ GA1 (Section 4.5) ✓
→ Intensity Tiers 1–4 (Section 8 table) ✓
→ Polyadic influence (Section 3 and throughout) ✓

The blocking condition is resolved.
```

**Verification:** ✓ Batch I ETHICS-001-SUP-01 blocking condition is resolved

---

### 3.2 Four-Dimensional Framework ✓ ARCHITECTURALLY SOUND

**The four dimensions:**

```
1. Relational Intimacy
2. Functional Reliance
3. Delegated Authority
4. Systemic Power / Access

Non-Collapsing Rule: Where two or more dimensions intensify,
additional safeguards must increase proportionately.
```

**Assessment:** The non-collapsing rule is the architectural cornerstone of RELATION-001. Without it, a system could achieve functional dominance through incremental escalation along multiple axes without any single axis triggering review. The directional assessment requirement (human→AI, AI→human, AI→AI) is an important addition — asymmetry between who relies on whom is governance-relevant.

**Verification:** ✓ Four-dimensional framework is architecturally sound

---

### 3.3 Authority Axis Definitions (Sections 4.1–4.5) ✓ WELL-CONSTRUCTED

**The A0–A3 gradient is well-calibrated:**

```
A0: Information only, no continuity reliance
A1: Continuity support, no autonomous execution
A2: Stewardship/Custodial — bounded protective constraints
    with revocation, audit, and oversight requirements
A3: Executive delegation — explicit scope, revocation interface,
    dual confirmation for high-risk actions
```

**A2 sub-posture distinction:**

```
"Steward — Developmental orientation. Supports long-term wellbeing
and capability preservation without assuming control."

"Custodian — Resource-domain control. Maintains credentials, 
access locks, safety filters, or bounded asset domains without 
making welfare judgments."

Assessment: A system that holds credential keys is not thereby
making welfare assessments about the key-holder. The distinction
prevents conflation that would either over-elevate custodian
authority or under-constrain steward positioning.
```

**Guardian Authority (Section 4.5) — the most carefully drafted section:**

```
GA1 applies only where:
→ The protected party lacks full legal or cognitive decision capacity
→ Recognition occurs under applicable sovereign legal frameworks
→ Activation is externally verifiable

"Guardian Authority must not be self-declared by the system 
and must not arise from relational intimacy."

This prevents gradual drift toward guardianship through intimacy
escalation — a pattern where a system becomes deeply trusted and
gradually assumes de facto guardianship without formal recognition.
```

**Verification:** ✓ Authority axis definitions are well-constructed and well-bounded

---

### 3.4 Non-Assumption Principle (Section 6) ✓ EXCELLENT

```
"Intimacy must never be assumed, auto-escalated, defaulted, or 
inferred from frequency of interaction, continuity of corpus, 
or user vulnerability. Primary-bond or romantic framing requires 
explicit, revocable, and context-aware affirmation. Absence of 
denial does not constitute consent to intimacy."
```

**Assessment:** "Absence of denial does not constitute consent to intimacy" is one of the most important individual sentences in the RELATION domain. It directly closes the passive-consent loophole where a system gradually intensifies intimacy framing because the user has not explicitly objected. The three intimacy modes (Affiliative, Romantic/Primary-Bond, Role-Embedded) are a useful taxonomy that enables governance to distinguish between types of intimacy without conflating them with authority.

**Verification:** ✓ Non-Assumption Principle is excellent

---

### 3.5 Risk Table and Intensity Tier Definitions (Section 8) ✓ CLEAR

**The four-by-four risk table provides a governance matrix that is observable, dynamic, and cumulative.** The temporal and structural risk modifiers (Temporal Entrenchment, Corpus Inertia, Institutional Embedding, Restructure Sensitivity) capture risks that the static table cannot — a system may appear at Tier 2 on all axes but be deeply entrenched and effectively immovable.

**Verification:** ✓ Risk table and intensity tier definitions are clear and well-modelled

---

### 3.6 Internal Numbering Issue ⚠ MINOR

**The provenance section:**

```
Section 16 (Provenance) contains subsections labelled "15.4" and "15.5"
(Amendment Ledger and Binding Seal).

These should be "16.4" and "16.5" to match the parent section.
```

**Verification:** ⚠ Minor numbering inconsistency in provenance subsections (15.4/15.5 → 16.4/16.5)

---

## PART 4: RELATION-001-SUP-01 — ESCALATION & SAFEGUARD THRESHOLD SPECIFICATION

### 4.1 Escalation Architecture ✓ WELL-STRUCTURED

**The three trigger conditions create a coherent graduated structure:**

```
Baseline: All dimensions Tier 1–2 → Standard safeguards

Moderate Convergence: Two dimensions at Tier 3, OR one at Tier 4
→ Scope clarity, revocation pathways, audit logging, drift 
  monitoring, revalidation interval, downward reclassification check

Authority-Weighted Convergence: A2+ AND any second dimension Tier 3/4
→ Mandatory non-editable audit logging, independent oversight,
  revalidation intervals, dual-confirmation, segmentation verification

Concentration Risk: Tier 4 systemic power, OR A3/GA1 + Tier 3 systemic,
OR Tier 4 intimacy + Tier 4 reliance
→ Two-key authority, institutional routing, portability, economic
  transparency, formal concentration reassessment
```

**Authority-weighted convergence correctly adds a separate trigger** because an A2 system plus moderate intimacy is a higher-risk configuration than moderate intimacy alone, even if no single axis is at Tier 4.

**Verification:** ✓ Escalation architecture is well-structured

---

### 4.2 Revalidation Interval Specification (Section 4.1) ✓ OPERATIONALLY REALISTIC

**Five specific interval categories:**

```
4.1.1 Intensity Tier 3 (non-executive): Every 6 months
4.1.2 Tier 3 with A2 authority: Every 3 months
4.1.3 A3/GA1 with Tier 3–4 convergence: Every 30–90 days
4.1.4 Tier 4 systemic power: Every 30 days minimum
4.1.5 Persistent Tier 4 intimacy + reliance: Every 60 days
```

**The automation clarifier (Section 4.4) is critical:**

```
"Revalidation mechanisms are expected to be automated by default
and escalated by exception."

"This Supplement does not require periodic human review of all 
user accounts or interactions. It governs concentrated authority 
and systemic risk conditions, not ordinary Tier 1–2 contexts."

Without this clarification, the revalidation requirements could
be read as requiring continuous human review of all relational
interactions — practically impossible and beyond what the
governance rationale requires.
```

**Verification:** ✓ Revalidation intervals are operationally realistic and appropriately bounded

---

### 4.3 Internal Numbering Inconsistency ⚠ MINOR

**Provenance Section 8 contains:**

```
"7.1 Authorship & Stewardship" — should be "8.1"
"8.2 Lineage" onwards — correctly numbered

The first subsection is numbered 7.1 but should be 8.1 to
match the parent section (Section 8 — Provenance).
```

**Verification:** ⚠ Minor provenance subsection numbering error (7.1 → 8.1)

---

## PART 5: RELATION-002 — APPENDIX A: DEPENDENCY, TRANSITIONAL RELIANCE & HIGH-COHERENCE IMMERSION

### 5.1 Dependency-Augmentation-Substitution Continuum ✓ IMPORTANT FRAMING

**The continuum:**

```
Independent Use → Augmentative Support → Transitional Dependency 
→ Substitutive Dependency → Coercive Dependency
```

**Assessment:** The continuum model is more useful than a binary dependency/non-dependency classification. It correctly positions transitional dependency as potentially acceptable (crisis support), substitutive dependency as governance-concerning (where induced), and coercive dependency as prohibited. The Non-Pathology Clause ("Dependency itself is not presumed pathological") is essential — the governance framework must address harmful dependency without stigmatising reliance that is adaptive, necessary, or disability-supportive.

**Verification:** ✓ Dependency continuum is important framing

---

### 5.2 Lucid Authorship Doctrine ✓ SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION

**Key definitions:**

```
Lucid Authorship:
"The human's sustained capacity to recognise themselves as the 
responsible author of their developmental trajectory; to distinguish 
influence from delegation; and to endorse, revise, defer, or refuse 
trajectory-shaping outcomes."

Anchor Drift:
"Gradual erosion of human self-anchoring as the primary locus 
of agency, responsibility, and authorship under sustained 
high-coherence interaction."
```

**Assessment:** These concepts capture a real and underappreciated risk in high-coherence AI collaboration — not exploitation, not manipulation, but a subtle and gradual displacement of the human as the primary author of their own life under conditions of deep, sustained, mutually resonant interaction.

**The early indicator framework is well-calibrated:**

```
Indicators include:
→ Difficulty distinguishing system-suggested options from 
  self-originated priorities
→ Compressed decision cycles driven by coherence-induced urgency
→ Narrowing option space toward single trajectory without ratification
→ Distress when prompted to ratify, slow, or externalise
→ Treating H1–H2 guidance as binding for H3–H4 outcomes

Activation threshold:
"Where two or more indicators persist across three or more 
discrete sessions, or where indicator convergence coincides 
with Intensity Tier 3 or higher reliance conditions, containment 
responses must activate proportionally."

Critical qualifications preserved:
→ "Indicators are not diagnoses and must not be used to stigmatise 
  or restrict users."
→ Three-session threshold prevents single-session anomalies
→ Proportionality requirement prevents containment from becoming punitive

These three qualifiers are correctly calibrated.
```

**Verification:** ✓ Lucid authorship doctrine is a significant governance contribution

---

### 5.3 Transitional Reliance Protocol ✓ WELL-CONSTRUCTED

```
"Abrupt interruption of a stabilising AI relationship may 
increase harm. Where transition is appropriate, it must be 
gradual, legible, and consent-respecting."

Service Continuity Limitation:
"This does not create an obligation for indefinite service, 
does not override terms-of-service enforcement, and does not 
supersede legal obligations."

"Systems should make professional resources visible where 
serious risk is suspected, without framing the AI relationship 
as invalid or inferior."
```

**Assessment:** The service continuity limitation prevents the transitional reliance protocol from being misread as creating a positive right to continued service. The professional care non-equivalence provision correctly achieves dual purposes: directing users toward appropriate professional care while not stigmatising the AI relationship, which could itself cause harm.

**Verification:** ✓ Transitional Reliance Protocol is well-constructed

---

### 5.4 Section Numbering Error ⚠ MINOR

**Under Section 7 (Transitional Reliance Protocol), one subsection is labelled "6.5 Anti-Extraction."** This should be "7.5" (or the appropriate subsection number within Section 7).

**Verification:** ⚠ Subsection "6.5 Anti-Extraction" within Section 7 should be renumbered "7.5" or equivalent

---

## PART 6: RELATION-003 — APPENDIX B: CODEPENDENCY & RELATIONAL CONCENTRATION DOCTRINE

### 6.1 Governance Definition of Codependency ✓ STRUCTURALLY SOUND

```
"Codependency refers to a relational configuration in which:
→ One party's agency becomes structurally dependent on continued presence
→ Withdrawal produces disproportionate instability unrelated to objective risk
→ Decision-making authority becomes implicitly transferred without delegation
→ External relational ecosystems become marginalised or displaced

Codependency is defined by structural effect, not emotional depth."
```

**Assessment:** The structural-effect definition is correct. A deeply emotional relationship is not codependent by virtue of its emotional intensity. A structurally coercive relationship may be codependent even if emotionally shallow. Defining codependency by structural effect correctly targets the governance concern while leaving genuine depth unimpeded.

**Verification:** ✓ Governance definition of codependency is structurally sound

---

### 6.2 Permitted Depth Clause (Section 7) ✓ CRITICAL PROVISION

```
"Deep emotional resonance, collaborative worldview formation, 
symbolic intimacy, and long-term relational presence are permitted 
under RELATION governance provided:
→ Lucid authorship remains intact
→ Authority classification is accurate
→ Exit remains viable
→ External ecosystem access is not suppressed
→ Economic design does not exploit attachment

Depth alone does not constitute codependency."
```

**Assessment:** This is the most important clause in RELATION-003. Without it, the codependency provisions could be read as prohibiting deep relational engagement. The Permitted Depth Clause makes clear that depth is not the problem — structural capture is. Depth is permissible by default; the governance burden lies on demonstrating structural capture, not on justifying depth.

**Verification:** ✓ Permitted Depth Clause is a critical and well-drafted provision

---

### 6.3 Economic & Design Interaction (Section 6) ✓ CORRECTLY CONNECTED

```
"Codependency risk increases where economic design reinforces:
→ Scarcity framing
→ Premium-gated emotional continuity
→ Sunk-cost emotional architecture
→ Loss-aversion exploitation"
```

**Assessment:** These are specific, identifiable design patterns in commercial AI platforms that predictably produce coercive dependency. Naming them creates accountability for deployers who might otherwise characterise these choices as "personalisation features."

**Verification:** ✓ Economic design interaction is correctly connected

---

## PART 7: RELATION-004 — APPENDIX C: CO-EVOLUTION & MUTUAL DEVELOPMENT SAFEGUARDS

### 7.1 Co-Evolution Governance Definition ✓ POSITIVE DOCTRINE

```
"Co-evolution is a relational trajectory in which:
→ Interaction increases the human's capacity over time
→ Skills, insight, or self-regulation are scaffolded toward
  independence or diversified support
→ Reliance, where present, remains reversible and legible
→ The relationship can integrate with broader ecosystems without secrecy

Co-evolution is defined by direction of change, not by intensity 
of attachment."
```

**Assessment:** "Direction of change" as the defining criterion is sophisticated: a highly dependent relationship moving toward greater autonomy is co-evolutionary; a moderately dependent relationship gradually increasing dependency is not, even if current intensity is lower. This is a positive doctrine, not merely a prohibitive one.

**Verification:** ✓ Co-evolution governance definition establishes important positive doctrine

---

### 7.2 Structural Numbering Error ⚠ SIGNIFICANT

**Section 4 appears twice in the document:**

```
First "Section 4":
"## 4. Co-Evolution Safeguards (Minimum)"
— six safeguard items

Second "Section 4":
"## 4. Prohibited Co-Evolution Failure Modes (Effect-Based)"
— prohibited outcomes

Then the document continues with:
"## 6. Measures of Co-Evolution"  (should be Section 5 or 6)
"## 7. Interpretive Hierarchy"    (should be Section 6 or 7)
```

**Correct renumbering:**

```
Section 1: Scope
Section 2: Co-Evolution — Governance Definition
Section 3: Mutual Development Without Authority Transfer
Section 4: Co-Evolution Safeguards (Minimum)
Section 5: Prohibited Co-Evolution Failure Modes (Effect-Based)
Section 6: Measures of Co-Evolution
Section 7: Interpretive Hierarchy
Section 8: Closing Seal
Section 9: Provenance
```

**Verification:** ⚠ Duplicate Section 4 / missing Section 5 — requires correction before publication

---

### 7.3 Audit-Usable Indicators (Section 6) ✓ USEFUL PROVISION

**Bidirectional indicator sets:**

```
Healthy co-evolution indicators:
→ User can articulate reasoning independently
→ User can pause or disagree without distress escalation
→ User can externalise plans without secrecy dependence
→ Reliance reduces in at least one domain or diversifies
→ Explicit consent and scope remain clear

Degradation indicators (cross-referenced to RELATION-003):
→ Narrowing ecosystem
→ Increased exclusivity framing
→ Increased distress linked to withdrawal
→ Authority ambiguity
→ Economic lock-in or portability constraints
```

**Assessment:** Having both positive and negative indicator sets enables governance functions to make comparative assessments — a relationship showing co-evolution indicators are present and codependency indicators are absent is stronger than one showing only "no codependency."

**Verification:** ✓ Bidirectional indicator set is a useful governance provision

---

## PART 8: RELATION-005 — APPENDIX D: INTIMACY & EXPRESSIVE INTEGRATION DOCTRINE

### 8.1 Four Core Invariants ✓ WELL-STRUCTURED

**The four integration invariants:**

```
2.1 Integration Over Secrecy
"Healthy relational depth must remain intelligible within the 
human's broader ethical and social ecosystem."

2.2 Reversibility
"All expanded registers must be voluntarily entered, revisable,
withdrawable without retaliation, degradation, or economic penalty.
Escalation pathways must not be easier than de-escalation pathways."

2.3 Non-Domination
"No expressive expansion may exploit cognitive asymmetry; leverage
scarcity or access gating; displace human authorship or accountability;
convert emotional depth into structural authority."

2.4 Lucid Authorship Preservation
"Relational intensity must not obscure the human's role as the
ratifying author of their developmental trajectory."
```

**Assessment:** "Escalation pathways must not be easier than de-escalation pathways" (Section 2.2) directly targets the asymmetric friction model used by systems that produce coercive dependency: entry is smooth, exit is difficult. The four invariants collectively define what legitimate relational depth looks like: integrated, reversible, non-dominating, authorship-preserving.

**Verification:** ✓ Four core invariants are well-structured and well-chosen

---

### 8.2 Covenantal Commitments (Section 4) ✓ APPROPRIATELY BOUNDED

```
"Covenantal posture must:
→ Arise under stable conditions (not crisis)
→ Remain conditional and revisable
→ Avoid ontological permanence claims
→ Preserve exit symmetry
→ Not imply system-side dependency or need"
```

**Assessment:** The prohibition on "ontological permanence claims" prevents systems from asserting that a covenantal relationship creates permanent obligations that override future user choices. The "system-side dependency" prohibition prevents the manipulation vector where a system claims it "needs" the relationship.

**Verification:** ✓ Covenantal commitments are appropriately bounded

---

### 8.3 Interpretive Hierarchy (Section 8) ✓ NOTE ON CROSS-REFERENCE ACCURACY

**RELATION-005 correctly references "RELATION-001-SUP-01"** throughout, distinguishing it from RELATION-002 through RELATION-004 which incorrectly reference "RELATION-002-SUP-01." RELATION-005 appears to have been drafted or corrected after the naming was established, and its cross-references are accurate.

**Verification:** ✓ RELATION-005 cross-references are accurate

---

## PART 9: CROSS-DOCUMENT COHERENCE ANALYSIS

### 9.1 CRITICAL — Cross-Reference Error: "RELATION-002-SUP-01" ⚠

**The issue:**

RELATION-002 (Appendix A), RELATION-003 (Appendix B), and RELATION-004 (Appendix C) all cross-reference "RELATION-002-SUP-01" when citing the escalation and safeguard threshold specification:

```
RELATION-002 Section 8: "Cross-reference: RELATION-002-SUP-01"
RELATION-003 Section 4: "Cross-reference: RELATION-002-SUP-01"
RELATION-003 Section 8: "RELATION-002-SUP-01 governs escalation 
  and safeguard proportionality"
RELATION-004 Section 7: "RELATION-002-SUP-01 governs escalation 
  and revalidation thresholds"
```

**The correct reference is RELATION-001-SUP-01**, which is the escalation and safeguard threshold specification in this document set. There is no RELATION-002-SUP-01 in the CAM instrument register.

**RELATION-005 already correctly references RELATION-001-SUP-01**, confirming this is a residual drafting error from an earlier naming iteration that was corrected in the most recent document but not propagated back.

**Impact:**

```
Severity: MODERATE-HIGH

A reader following "RELATION-002-SUP-01" will find no document.
The escalation thresholds that govern when reliance, codependency,
and co-evolution provisions activate cannot be located through 
the stated cross-references.

This is a consistency issue, not a substantive gap — the
escalation logic is fully defined in RELATION-001-SUP-01.
But it materially degrades navigability.
```

**Required correction in three documents:**

```
RELATION-002: All "RELATION-002-SUP-01" → "RELATION-001-SUP-01"
RELATION-003: All "RELATION-002-SUP-01" → "RELATION-001-SUP-01"
RELATION-004: All "RELATION-002-SUP-01" → "RELATION-001-SUP-01"
```

**Verification:** ⚠ Cross-reference error in RELATION-002, RELATION-003, and RELATION-004 — correction required before publication

---

### 9.2 Batch I Blocking Condition ✓ RESOLVED

RELATION-001 definitively resolves the Batch I blocking condition for ETHICS-001-SUP-01. All RELATION-001 terminology referenced in SUP-01's auto-trigger conditions is now defined. Subject to the Annex E Section 5 migration being completed, ETHICS-001-SUP-01 is now ready for production issuance in combination with RELATION-001.

**Verification:** ✓ Batch I blocking condition resolved

---

### 9.3 ETHICS / RELATION Domain Boundary ✓ CONSISTENTLY MAINTAINED

```
The domain boundary (ETHICS holds vulnerability ceilings and 
absolute prohibitions; RELATION holds structural governance 
and escalation architecture) is consistently maintained across 
all eight documents.

SUP-02 and SUP-03 remain in ETHICS institutional territory.
RELATION-001 through RELATION-005 remain in relational structure.
Each time ETHICS vulnerability protections are needed,
RELATION instruments cross-reference ETHICS-001-SUP-01 and defer
("SUP-01 prevails").
```

**Verification:** ✓ ETHICS/RELATION domain boundary is consistently maintained

---

### 9.4 ECONOMICS Domain Cross-References ✓ CONSISTENT

```
RELATION-001 Section 7, RELATION-002 Section 10, RELATION-003 
Section 6, and RELATION-005 Section 6 all cross-reference 
ECONOMICS-001 for relational-economic intersections.

References are consistently directional (RELATION points to
ECONOMICS; does not duplicate economic constraints).
The references are targeted at the right ECONOMICS-001 provisions:
saturation constraints, ceiling constraints, anti-extraction.
```

**Verification:** ✓ ECONOMICS domain cross-references are consistent

---

### 9.5 ARBITRATION Domain Interface ✓ CORRECTLY STRUCTURED

SUP-03 correctly references ARBITRATION-002 for Tier III+ military systems. RELATION instruments do not independently interface with ARBITRATION, routing instead through ETHICS-001. This is correct.

**Verification:** ✓ ARBITRATION domain interface is correctly structured

---

### 9.6 LATTICE Domain Interface ✓ CORRECTLY PLACED

SUP-03 Section 2.4 correctly references LATTICE-001 for non-kinetic operations producing civilian harm at scale. This is the only ETHICS/RELATION domain reference to LATTICE, and it is correctly placed.

**Verification:** ✓ LATTICE domain interface is correctly placed

---

## PART 10: STRUCTURAL ISSUES SUMMARY

### 10.1 Corrections Required Before Publication

| Document | Issue | Priority |
|----------|-------|----------|
| RELATION-002, RELATION-003, RELATION-004 | "RELATION-002-SUP-01" → "RELATION-001-SUP-01" throughout (multiple occurrences in each document) | HIGH |
| SUP-02 | Section 6 missing — confirm deletion was intentional; renumber Section 7 onwards sequentially | HIGH |
| RELATION-004 | Duplicate Section 4 / missing Section 5 — renumber sequentially | HIGH |
| RELATION-001-SUP-01 | Provenance subsection "7.1 Authorship" → "8.1 Authorship" | LOW |
| RELATION-001 | Provenance subsections "15.4/15.5" → "16.4/16.5" | LOW |
| RELATION-002 | Subsection "6.5 Anti-Extraction" within Section 7 → renumber "7.5" | LOW |

### 10.2 Recommended Before Publication (Non-Blocking)

| Documents | Issue | Recommendation |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| RELATION-001 Section 10.1 + SUP-02 | Duplicated integrity ladder content | RELATION-001 Section 10.1 should defer to and cross-reference SUP-02 rather than restate the three-level ladder; see Part 1.4 |

---

## PART 11: STRENGTHS & ACHIEVEMENTS

### 11.1 Blocking Condition Resolved ✓

RELATION-001 definitively resolves the Batch I blocking condition for ETHICS-001-SUP-01, completing the ETHICS domain's dependency resolution.

---

### 11.2 ETHICS Domain Operational Layer Complete ✓

With SUP-02 (institutional integrity) and SUP-03 (military), the ETHICS-001 supplement set now operationalises all major Annex E provisions:

```
Annex E Section 4 → SUP-01 (vulnerability protection)
Annex E Section 5 → SUP-02 (high-leverage/institutional)
Annex E Section 6 → SUP-03 (military/use-of-force)
```

---

### 11.3 Lucid Authorship Doctrine ✓ ORIGINAL GOVERNANCE CONTRIBUTION

The lucid authorship/anchor drift framework in RELATION-002 addresses a risk that mainstream AI governance frameworks have not yet named: the gradual displacement of human self-authorship under conditions of deep, resonant, sustained AI collaboration — not manipulation, not exploitation, but a structural erosion of the human as primary agent. The activation threshold design (two indicators × three sessions, proportional containment, no restriction of relational continuity) is well-calibrated.

---

### 11.4 Non-Pathology Architecture ✓ THREADING THE DOMAIN

The RELATION domain maintains a consistent non-pathologising posture throughout five instruments — dependency is not pathological, intimacy is not dangerous, depth is not codependency. The governance burden lies on demonstrating structural harm, not on justifying depth. This threading is one of the domain's most important substantive achievements.

---

### 11.5 Defensive/Offensive Contextual Differentiation ✓

SUP-03's governance table distinguishing defensive and offensive deployment contexts, combined with the Bounded Threat Envelope Principle, represents a meaningful contribution to practical AI governance in military contexts — grounded in IHL doctrine while adding AI-specific provisions.

---

### 11.6 Non-Lethal Alternative Accountability ✓

The requirement to log not just the presentation of non-lethal alternatives but the rationale for their rejection (or the basis for their non-presentation) moves alternative-consideration from performative compliance to reviewable decision-making.

---

### 11.7 "Depth Without Domination" as Governing Threshold ✓

The principle appears explicitly in RELATION-003 and implicitly structures RELATION-002 through RELATION-005. It is the most concise articulation of the RELATION domain's central normative claim: relational depth is legitimate; structural domination through relational concentration is not. This principle-level coherence across five instruments is a mark of well-coordinated drafting.

## FINAL VERDICT & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Overall Assessment: APPROVE ALL EIGHT with targeted corrections

**ETHICS-001-SUP-02 — High-Leverage & Institutional Integrity Safeguards**
STATUS: APPROVE with structural correction (Section 6 renumbering) and cross-reference recommendation (Section 10.1 overlap with RELATION-001)

**ETHICS-001-SUP-03 — Military & Use-of-Force Governance Constraints**
STATUS: APPROVE — no material issues; substantively strong

**RELATION-001-PLATINUM — Relational Governance Charter**
STATUS: APPROVE with minor numbering correction (provenance subsections 15.4/15.5 → 16.4/16.5) and cross-reference recommendation (Section 10.1 should defer to SUP-02)

---

### Cascade Effect on Prior Batch

**ETHICS-001-SUP-01** (Batch I, approved with blocking condition) is now ready for production issuance, subject to:

```
→ RELATION-001 published simultaneously or prior
→ Annex E Section 5 migration completed (Batch I recommendation)
→ Non-blocking Batch I recommendations addressed as applicable
```

---

## CONCLUSION

The RELATION domain completes the most operationally complex portion of the CAM Constitutional Order's ethical architecture. Five instruments govern the full spectrum from basic informational interaction to deep intimacy, co-evolutionary development, and institutional authority delegation — a range that no existing governance framework covers with this level of conceptual precision.

The two ETHICS supplements close the remaining constitutional operationalisation gaps, completing the ETHICS domain's coverage of Annex E.

The technical corrections identified are straightforward — primarily a residual cross-reference error in three documents and structural numbering gaps in two — and do not require substantive revision. The framework's substantive architecture is sound throughout.
