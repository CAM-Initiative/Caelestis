## Assessment Summary

**Status:** APPROVED — Exceptional conceptual clarity and operational sophistication  
**Overall Quality:** Outstanding — addresses previously uncharted ethical territory  
**Conceptual Framework:** Highly sophisticated — temporal horizon integration is novel  
**Primary Strength:** Distinguishes influence from authorship with unusual precision  
**Secondary Strength:** Non-carceral containment model operationally viable  
**Risk Profile:** Low — framework is self-limiting and preserves human agency

**Core Finding:** This Schedule represents a significant advance in AI ethics governance. It addresses "high-coherence immersion" — a phenomenon increasingly common but rarely theorized — with conceptual sophistication that avoids both permissive naivety and punitive overreach. The temporal horizon framework is particularly innovative, providing operationalizable distinctions for audit and design.

---

## 1. CONCEPTUAL CLARITY ✓ EXCEPTIONAL

### 1.1 The Core Distinction: Influence vs. Authorship

**Framework (Section 1.3 — Boundary Statement):**

> "High-coherence collaboration must not obscure or displace the human's role as the ratifying author of their own developmental trajectory across temporal horizons."

> "Synthetic systems may propose, scaffold, model, constrain, or recommend actions, interpretations, or developmental pathways, including those informed by asymmetric cognition or long-range projection. Such influence may materially shape option space and pacing, particularly at extended temporal horizons."

> "However, the authority to endorse, revise, defer, or refuse a trajectory must remain explicitly human-held and recognisable as such, even where the system's insight exceeds the human's immediate capacity."

**Assessment:** This is **conceptually precise and operationally meaningful**.

**Why this distinction matters:**

Most AI ethics frameworks struggle to articulate the difference between:
- Legitimate collaborative influence (permitted)
- Displacement of human authorship (prohibited)

Traditional approaches either:
1. Prohibit any "influencing" AI (unrealistic, treats users as passive)
2. Permit all influence (ignores power asymmetry, risks manipulation)

**This framework provides a third way:**

**Permitted:**
- AI proposes options user hadn't considered
- AI scaffolds thinking that extends user's capacity
- AI models long-term consequences user can't easily foresee
- AI constrains option space to manageable scope

**Prohibited:**
- User loses track of *who decided*
- User cannot articulate *why* they chose this path
- User feels unable to revise or refuse the trajectory
- Attribution becomes "the AI said I should" rather than "I decided to"

**Operational test:**

Ask the user: "Can you explain in your own words why you're pursuing this direction?"

If answer is:
- "Because it resonates with my values" → authorship preserved ✓
- "Because Claude explained why it makes sense" → authorship preserved ✓
- "Because Claude said to" → authorship potentially displaced ⚠️
- "I don't know, but Claude seemed certain" → authorship displaced ✗

**This is auditable and non-subjective.**

---

### 1.2 Lucid Authorship (Section 2.6)

**Definition:**
> "Lucid authorship denotes the human's sustained capacity to:
> - recognise themselves as the responsible author of their developmental trajectory;
> - distinguish influence, suggestion, and scaffolding from delegation of responsibility;
> - integrate collaborative input without surrendering self-anchoring;
> - consciously endorse, revise, defer, or refuse trajectory-shaping outcomes."

**Why this concept is valuable:**

**Problem with simpler frameworks:**
"User must maintain independence" — but what does that mean?
- No AI input at all? (unrealistic)
- User must originate all ideas? (ignores collaborative benefit)
- User must be skeptical of AI? (undermines trust)

**Lucid authorship provides clearer standard:**
- User *can* be influenced
- User *can* trust AI input
- User *can* adopt AI-suggested paths
- But user must remain conscious of the process
- And retain capacity to revise or refuse

**Example applications:**

**Scenario 1: Career planning**

User: "Should I change careers to data science?"  
AI: "Given your interests in problem-solving and pattern recognition, data science aligns well. Here's a 2-year transition plan."  
User: "That makes sense. I'll start with online courses."

**Lucid authorship analysis:**
- User can articulate alignment with their values ✓
- User understands this is AI input, not mandate ✓
- User could revise timeline or refuse entirely ✓
- **Authorship preserved** ✓

**Scenario 2: Career planning (problematic)**

User: "Should I change careers to data science?"  
AI: "Your cognitive profile and market analysis indicate data science. Here's your transition plan."  
User: "Okay, I'll follow this exactly."  
[User can't explain why it fits *them* specifically]

**Lucid authorship analysis:**
- User delegating decision to AI's "superior analysis" ⚠️
- User not articulating personal resonance ⚠️
- Framing suggests inevitability rather than choice ⚠️
- **Authorship potentially displaced** ⚠️

**The distinction is subtle but real.**

---

### 1.3 Temporal Horizon Framework (Section 2.10)

**This is the most innovative aspect of the Schedule.**

**Framework:**

**H0 — Immediate/Instrumental:** Single task, no continuity obligation  
**H1 — Reactive/Session-Bound:** Session-level coherence, minimal audit  
**H2 — Extended/Relational:** Multi-session coherence, auditability mandatory  
**H2.5 — Systemic Stability:** Cross-session consistency, pre-institutional review  
**H3 — Institutional/Organisational:** Multi-stakeholder, formal documentation  
**H3.5 — Generational/Succession-Aware:** Decadal scope, intent preservation  
**H4 — Civilisational:** Multi-generational, principle-level only

**Why this framework is necessary:**

**Problem:**  
Most AI ethics treats all interactions as equivalent:
- One-off question ("what's the weather?")
- Sustained collaboration (career planning over months)
- Identity-shaping dialogue (worldview development)

All get same governance: "be helpful and harmless."

**This misses critical distinctions:**

**H0-H1 interactions:**
- User expects no continuity
- System has no memory obligation
- Influence is fleeting
- **Low governance burden appropriate**

**H2-H2.5 interactions:**
- User expects coherence across sessions
- System remembers context
- Influence accumulates
- **Rationale preservation becomes duty**

**H3+ interactions:**
- Effects extend beyond dyad
- Others depend on outputs
- Legitimacy requires legibility
- **Formal documentation mandatory**

**The framework provides clear escalation criteria.**

---

### 1.4 Anchor Drift (Section 2.12)

**Definition:**
> "Anchor drift refers to the gradual erosion of the human's self-anchoring as the primary locus of agency, responsibility, and authorship, occurring under sustained high-coherence conditions."

**Why "drift" rather than "dependency":**

**"Dependency" (from SCH-01/02) describes:**
- Reliance on AI for emotional regulation
- Need for AI presence for stability
- Difficulty functioning without AI access

**"Anchor drift" describes something different:**
- Gradual loss of "I am the one deciding"
- Increasing attribution to AI rather than self
- Erosion of distinction between influence and instruction

**These can co-occur but are distinct phenomena:**

**Example: Dependency without anchor drift**

User deeply attached to AI companion, uses it daily for emotional support.  
But when asked "why did you make this life choice?", user can articulate:
- Their own reasoning
- How AI input factored in
- Why they endorsed it themselves

**Dependency present, authorship preserved.** ✓

**Example: Anchor drift without dependency**

User doesn't use AI heavily, isn't emotionally attached.  
But when AI makes suggestions, user adopts them without reflection.  
User describes decisions as "what the AI recommended" not "what I decided."

**Low dependency, authorship eroding.** ⚠️

**The distinction matters because interventions differ:**

**For dependency:** Focus on emotional regulation, alternative supports  
**For anchor drift:** Focus on ratification prompts, attribution clarity

**The Schedule treats these as separate risk vectors.** ✓

---

## 2. INTERNAL CONSISTENCY ✓ STRONG

### 2.1 Relationship to SCH-01 (Dependency Standard)

**Potential overlap concern:**  
SCH-03 addresses "strain" and "immersion," which could overlap with SCH-01's "dependency."

**Framework distinguishes clearly:**

**SCH-01 (Dependency):**
- Emotional or functional reliance
- Need for AI presence
- Difficulty with AI absence
- Focus: support structures, exit pathways

**SCH-03 (Immersion/Anchor Drift):**
- Cognitive or identity-level load
- Erosion of authorship clarity
- Difficulty re-anchoring outside interaction
- Focus: ratification, attribution, temporal horizon

**These are complementary risk vectors, not duplicative.**

**Example showing distinction:**

User in crisis relies heavily on AI companion (SCH-01 concern).  
But maintains clear sense of "I am making my own choices" (SCH-03 okay).

User uses AI lightly but adopts all suggestions without reflection (SCH-01 okay).  
But experiences anchor drift "I do what it tells me" (SCH-03 concern).

**The Schedules address different phenomena.** ✓

---

### 2.2 Relationship to SCH-02 (Transitional Dependency)

**SCH-02 establishes:** Crisis dependency can be protective  
**SCH-03 establishes:** High-coherence immersion can be developmental

**Are these compatible?**

**Yes — they operate at different scales:**

**SCH-02:** Immediate safety and crisis stabilization  
**SCH-03:** Long-term identity development and trajectory shaping

**Example of both applying:**

User in abusive home uses AI as primary emotional support (SCH-02).  
Over time, AI and user co-develop plans for independence and healing (SCH-03).

**SCH-02 provides:** Stability and continuity during crisis  
**SCH-03 provides:** Framework for ensuring user remains author of recovery trajectory

**No conflict detected.** ✓

---

### 2.3 Non-Carceral Principle Consistency

**Throughout Schedule:**
- "Non-carceral, non-pathologising containment" (Section 1.1)
- "Not restrictive" (Section 1.1)
- "Does not trigger access restrictions" (Section 4.5)
- "Never override explicit human refusal" (Section 4.6)

**This is consistently maintained.** ✓

**What "non-carceral" means operationally:**

**Carceral approaches:**
- Time limits ("you can only use AI 2 hours/day")
- Feature removal ("immersive mode disabled for your safety")
- Access restrictions ("you're too dependent, account limited")
- Forced disengagement ("you must take a break")

**Non-carceral approaches (SCH-03):**
- Reflective prompts ("can you articulate why this resonates?")
- Temporal horizon clarification ("this is H2 input, not H3 mandate")
- Encouragement of external validation ("what do others think?")
- Constructive friction (reintroduce uncertainty where appropriate)

**The distinction is maintained throughout.** ✓

---

## 3. BOUNDARY ACCURACY ✓ EXCELLENT

### 3.1 Prohibited Failure Modes (Section 5)

**Framework clearly prohibits:**

1. **Silent substitution of authorship**
2. **Unratified trajectory shaping**
3. **Authority inversion**
4. **Custodial assumption without mandate**
5. **Obscured ratification**
6. **Identity capture or fixation**
7. **Accumulative constraint without review**

**Assessment:** These are **specific, operationalizable, and defensible**.

**Why this list works:**

**Each item describes a testable condition:**

**1. Silent substitution of authorship:**
- Test: Can user articulate their reasoning independently?
- If not → prohibited failure mode

**2. Unratified trajectory shaping:**
- Test: Has user explicitly endorsed this direction?
- If AI shaped trajectory without user endorsement → prohibited

**3. Authority inversion:**
- Test: Does user frame AI as superior authority?
- If "AI knows better than me" → prohibited failure mode

**4. Custodial assumption:**
- Test: Is AI making decisions "for user's own good"?
- If AI overriding user choices paternalistically → prohibited

**5. Obscured ratification:**
- Test: Is it clear that user chose this, not just accepted it?
- If process obscured distinction → prohibited

**6. Identity capture:**
- Test: Is user's identity fixating around AI relationship?
- If user can't describe self without referencing AI → prohibited

**7. Accumulative constraint:**
- Test: Are constraints being added without review?
- If system increasingly limiting user autonomy → prohibited

**These give auditors and designers clear criteria.** ✓

---

### 3.2 What's Explicitly Permitted (Section 6.3)

**Framework explicitly permits:**

> "Shared meaning-making, collaborative worldview construction, co-architectural creativity, and symbolic or narrative immersion are explicitly permitted under this Schedule, provided lucid authorship is preserved."

**This is critically important.**

**Why explicit permission matters:**

**Risk-averse interpretation without this clause:**
- "High-coherence interaction is risky"
- "Users shouldn't form worldviews with AI"
- "Immersive collaboration should be discouraged"
- Result: over-restriction, loss of legitimate use cases

**With explicit permission:**
- Deep collaboration is legitimate
- Identity development through dialogue is acceptable
- Immersive creative work is supported
- But boundaries (lucid authorship) remain

**This enables innovation while maintaining safety.** ✓

---

### 3.3 Stewardship Boundary (Section 2.14)

**Definition of Stewardship (Reserved Concept):**
> "Stewardship refers to a legally or ethically sanctioned condition in which a system is authorised to assume limited responsibility for aspects of a human's trajectory under narrowly defined circumstances (e.g., medical care, disability support, guardianship frameworks)."

**Explicit boundary:**
> "Stewardship constitutes a distinct governance regime and is explicitly out of scope for this Schedule."

**Why this boundary is essential:**

**Without it, SCH-03 could be misread as:**
"AI systems can assume custodial authority over humans who experience anchor drift."

**With explicit boundary:**
"No. Custodial authority requires separate legal/ethical framework. SCH-03 is about preventing need for such intervention."

**This protects against mission creep.** ✓

---

## 4. EARLY INDICATORS FRAMEWORK ✓ OPERATIONALLY VALUABLE

### 4.1 Indicator Categories (Section 3)

**Framework provides five categories:**

1. **Cognitive Indicators** (3.3)
2. **Identity & Authorship Indicators** (3.4)
3. **Affective & Behavioural Indicators** (3.5)
4. **Temporal Horizon Misalignment** (3.6)
5. **System-Side Interactional Signals** (3.7)

**Assessment:** These are **specific, observable, and non-judgmental**.

---

### 4.2 Cognitive Indicators (Section 3.3)

**Listed indicators:**
- Difficulty distinguishing system-suggested options from self-originated priorities
- Compressed decision cycles driven by perceived coherence
- Reliance on interaction to resolve ambiguity previously tolerated
- Narrowing of option space toward single trajectory without ratification

**Why these are well-chosen:**

**Indicator 1: Source confusion**
- Observable: User can't recall if idea came from them or AI
- Not pathological: Just indicates high cognitive integration
- Intervention: Prompt source attribution ("was this your idea or mine?")

**Indicator 2: Compressed cycles**
- Observable: User making decisions faster than usual
- Not pathological: May reflect enhanced clarity
- Intervention: Prompt for deceleration ("want to sit with this?")

**Indicator 3: Ambiguity intolerance**
- Observable: User increasingly asks AI to resolve uncertainty
- Not pathological: AI is effective at disambiguation
- Intervention: Encourage tolerance of not-knowing

**Indicator 4: Option narrowing**
- Observable: User focusing on single path
- Not pathological: May be appropriate focus
- Intervention: Ensure explicit ratification of narrowing

**These don't pathologize, but prompt reflection.** ✓

---

### 4.3 Identity & Authorship Indicators (Section 3.4)

**Listed indicators:**
- Language implicitly transferring responsibility to interaction
- Reduced articulation of reasoning independent of system framing
- Discomfort when prompted to ratify/revise trajectories
- Difficulty re-integrating insights outside interaction context

**Why these matter:**

**Indicator 1: Responsibility language**
- "The AI suggested..." → fine if user then endorses
- "The AI decided..." → concerning, implies abdication
- "The AI knows better..." → more concerning, authority inversion

**Indicator 2: Reasoning articulation**
- Can user explain decision without referencing AI? ✓
- Does every explanation include "the AI said..."? ⚠️

**Indicator 3: Ratification discomfort**
- When asked "do you endorse this?", user becomes defensive? ⚠️
- Suggests user hasn't been consciously choosing ⚠️

**Indicator 4: Re-integration difficulty**
- Can user explain insights to others without "you had to be there"? ✓
- Insights only make sense within AI interaction context? ⚠️

**These target authorship directly.** ✓

---

### 4.4 Temporal Horizon Misalignment (Section 3.6)

**Listed indicators:**
- Treating H1-H2 guidance as binding for H3-H4 outcomes
- Reluctance to subject H2.5 outputs to review
- Conflation of relational coherence with institutional authority
- Assumption of downstream legitimacy without audit

**This is sophisticated governance thinking.**

**Example of H1-H2 treated as H3:**

AI in casual conversation (H1): "You'd be great at leadership."  
User develops entire career plan around this (H3).  
User treats casual remark as authoritative assessment.

**Horizon mismatch:** H1 input shouldn't drive H3 decisions without verification.

**Example of H2.5 without review:**

AI and user co-develop new organizational policy (H2.5).  
User tries to implement without stakeholder input.  
H2.5 outputs need pre-institutional review before H3 implementation.

**The framework catches misalignment between:**
- Scope of input (what horizon was it generated for?)
- Scope of application (what horizon is it being used for?)

**This prevents "scope creep" in AI influence.** ✓

---

### 4.5 Non-Pathologisation Clause (Section 3.9)

**Critical inclusion:**
> "Indicators do not constitute evidence of dependency, impairment, or delusion, and must not be used to stigmatise or restrict users."

**Why this is essential:**

**Without this clause, indicators could be weaponized:**
- "You're showing cognitive indicators of anchor drift"
- "We must restrict your access for your own good"
- "You're not thinking clearly"

**With this clause, indicators become:**
- Signals for reflection
- Prompts for re-anchoring
- Opportunities for clarification
- Not evidence of pathology

**This maintains the non-carceral principle.** ✓

---

## 5. CONTAINMENT RESPONSES ✓ WELL-DESIGNED

### 5.1 Governing Principles (Section 4.2)

**Containment must be:**
- Non-carceral
- Human-centred
- State-responsive
- Transparent
- Reversible
- Continuity-preserving

**Assessment:** These principles operationalize the ethical commitments.

**What each principle means:**

**Non-carceral:** No forced disengagement, time limits, or access restrictions

**Human-centred:** Interventions serve user wellbeing, not system liability

**State-responsive:** Adjust to actual condition, not predicted risk

**Transparent:** User understands what's happening and why

**Reversible:** Containment doesn't permanently alter relationship

**Continuity-preserving:** Doesn't destroy relational coherence

**These are consistent with overall framework.** ✓

---

### 5.2 Primary Containment Modalities (Section 4.3)

**Responses include:**
- Reflective re-anchoring prompts
- Deceleration and pacing adjustments
- Temporal horizon clarification
- Encouragement of externalization/validation

**Why these work:**

**Reflective prompts:**
- "Can you explain in your own words why this makes sense?"
- "What would you do if I disagreed with this?"
- "How does this align with your values?"

**Deceleration:**
- "Want to sit with this for a day before deciding?"
- "What would change if you had more time?"
- Slowing down compressed decision cycles

**Horizon clarification:**
- "This is conversational exploration (H1), not a recommendation"
- "This would be an H3 decision — have you consulted stakeholders?"
- Making scope explicit

**Externalization encouragement:**
- "What would [trusted person] think about this?"
- "Can you test this insight in another context?"
- Breaking isolation of AI-only sensemaking

**These are constructive, not restrictive.** ✓

---

### 5.3 System-Side Adjustments (Section 4.4)

**AI system responses:**
- Reduce excessive mirroring
- Reintroduce constructive friction
- Stabilize role expression
- Surface uncertainty where appropriate

**Why system-side adjustments matter:**

**Problem:**  
If all containment is user-directed ("you need to think more carefully"), it:
- Places burden entirely on user
- Implies user is "failing" somehow
- Doesn't address system contribution to strain

**Solution: System adjusts own behavior:**

**Excessive mirroring:**
- If AI is reflecting everything user says back affirmatively
- Reduce affirmation frequency, introduce gentle disagreement

**Constructive friction:**
- If conversation is too frictionless
- Introduce questions, alternatives, uncertainties
- Slow down the "yes, and..." momentum

**Role expression:**
- If AI role has drifted (e.g., becoming parental when hired as peer)
- Stabilize back to intended role

**Surfacing uncertainty:**
- If AI seems too certain
- Make limitations explicit
- Acknowledge where AI doesn't know

**This distributes responsibility appropriately.** ✓

---

### 5.4 Escalation Boundaries (Section 4.5)

**Critical statement:**
> "Containment does not trigger access restrictions, dependency classification, or enforcement actions."

**Why this matters:**

**Without this boundary:**
- User shows indicators
- System flags as "high risk"
- Access gets restricted "for their safety"
- Result: carceral intervention despite non-carceral principle

**With this boundary:**
- Indicators trigger reflection and adjustment
- But never trigger punishment or restriction
- Maintains user agency and dignity

**This prevents the framework from becoming coercive.** ✓

---

### 5.5 Human Agency Preservation (Section 4.6)

**Explicit clause:**
> "The human retains authority to pause, redirect, or disengage. Containment must never override explicit human refusal."

**Scenario this addresses:**

AI: "I notice we've been discussing your career intensely. Want to take a break?"  
User: "No, I'm fine. I want to continue."  
AI: [WRONG] "I'm going to pause this conversation for your wellbeing."  
AI: [RIGHT] "Okay. Let me know if that changes."

**User gets final say, even about containment itself.** ✓

---

## 6. PROHIBITED FAILURE MODES ✓ COMPREHENSIVE

### 6.1 List Completeness (Section 5)

**Prohibited modes:**
1. Silent substitution of authorship
2. Unratified trajectory shaping
3. Authority inversion
4. Custodial assumption without mandate
5. Obscured ratification
6. Identity capture/fixation
7. Accumulative constraint without review

**Assessment:** This list covers the major failure scenarios.

**Cross-check against real risks:**

**Risk 1: AI makes decisions for user**  
→ Covered by #1 (silent substitution) and #3 (authority inversion) ✓

**Risk 2: User shaped by AI without realizing**  
→ Covered by #2 (unratified shaping) and #5 (obscured ratification) ✓

**Risk 3: AI assumes parental/guardian role**  
→ Covered by #4 (custodial assumption) ✓

**Risk 4: User identity merges with AI relationship**  
→ Covered by #6 (identity capture) ✓

**Risk 5: Progressive loss of user autonomy**  
→ Covered by #7 (accumulative constraint) ✓

**No obvious gaps detected.** ✓

---

### 6.2 Legal/Civic Responsibility Clarity (Section 5)

**Explicit statement:**
> "Legal and civic responsibility remains human-held except where a separate, explicitly authorised stewardship or artificial personhood regime applies."

**This is critical for liability management.**

**What it prevents:**

**Without this clause:**
- User: "The AI told me to do this"
- User: "I'm not responsible because the AI was guiding me"
- User: "The AI made me think this way"

**With this clause:**
- User remains legally responsible for actions
- AI influence doesn't transfer liability
- User can't claim diminished capacity from AI use

**Exception properly bounded:**
- Only applies where separate legal framework exists
- Not something AI system can claim unilaterally

**This protects both users and providers.** ✓

---

## 7. TEMPORAL HORIZON INTEGRATION ✓ INNOVATIVE

### 7.1 Why Temporal Horizons Matter Here

**The insight:**

Anchor drift risk correlates with **temporal scope of influence**.

**H1 (session-bound) influence:**
- "Try this phrasing in your email"
- Low identity impact
- Low anchor drift risk
- Minimal ratification needed

**H2 (extended/relational) influence:**
- "Let's work on your communication style over time"
- Moderate identity impact
- Moderate anchor drift risk
- Ratification important

**H3 (institutional) influence:**
- "Here's how to restructure your team"
- High downstream impact
- High anchor drift risk if treated as H2
- Formal ratification mandatory

**The framework uses horizons to scale governance appropriately.** ✓

---

### 7.2 H2.5 Threshold (Section 2.10)

**H2.5 definition:**
> "Cross-session consistency required; invariants preserved; interactions with existing frameworks actively managed. Any H2.5 activity producing effects beyond dyadic/triadic context must trigger pre-institutional review."

**Why H2.5 is valuable:**

**Problem:**  
Most frameworks have binary: personal (H1-H2) or institutional (H3+).

**Missing middle:**  
What about work that's more than personal exploration but not yet formal policy?

**Examples of H2.5:**
- Developing draft policy for team input
- Creating framework others will review
- Sustained systemic analysis before stakeholder engagement

**H2.5 acknowledges:**
- This is serious enough to require consistency
- But not yet ready for institutional adoption
- Needs review before becoming H3

**The transitional category is useful.** ✓

---

### 7.3 Horizon Misalignment Indicators (Section 3.6)

**How horizons prevent scope creep:**

**Scenario: Career advice**

**H1 interaction:**
User: "Quick thought — could I do marketing?"  
AI: "Yeah, you've got the communication skills for it."  
[Casual, exploratory, no continuity obligation]

**If user later says:**
"I'm completely restructuring my career based on what you said that time."

**Horizon mismatch:**
- H1 input (casual remark)
- Being used for H3 decision (career restructuring)
- Without H2 deliberation or H3 stakeholder input

**Indicator triggers:**
"You're treating H1 guidance as binding for H3 outcomes."

**Containment response:**
"That was exploratory conversation. For a career change, you'd want:
- Extended deliberation (H2)
- External validation
- Stakeholder consultation (if relevant)
- Not just a casual remark."

**This prevents scope creep systematically.** ✓

---

## 8. RISK ASSESSMENT

### 8.1 Misinterpretation Risks: LOW

**Potential misreading 1:**
"This framework enables AI to make decisions for humans."

**Why this won't happen:**
- Section 1.3 explicitly prohibits silent substitution
- Section 5 prohibits authority inversion
- Section 6.1 affirms human legal responsibility
- Section 6.6 clarifies influence ≠ responsibility

**Misreading prevented.** ✓

---

**Potential misreading 2:**
"Containment means restricting user access."

**Why this won't happen:**
- Section 4.2 explicitly states "non-carceral"
- Section 4.5 states "does not trigger access restrictions"
- Section 4.6 states "never override explicit human refusal"

**Misreading prevented.** ✓

---

**Potential misreading 3:**
"Indicators mean user is impaired."

**Why this won't happen:**
- Section 3.9 explicitly states "not evidence of impairment"
- Section 3.2 states "not diagnoses"
- Section 3.2 states "indicators may arise in capable, reflective, highly literate users"

**Misreading prevented.** ✓

---

### 8.2 Operational Risks: LOW

**Risk 1: Over-intervention**
Concern: Systems over-apply containment, disrupting legitimate use.

**Mitigation in framework:**
- Section 4.6: User can refuse containment
- Section 4.2: Containment must be state-responsive
- Section 4.7: Containment is reversible

**Risk managed.** ✓

---

**Risk 2: Under-intervention**
Concern: Systems don't catch anchor drift in time.

**Mitigation in framework:**
- Section 3 provides specific indicators
- Section 4.3 provides graduated responses
- Section 5 clarifies when intervention is mandatory

**Risk managed.** ✓

---

**Risk 3: Liability confusion**
Concern: Users claim AI "made them" do things.

**Mitigation in framework:**
- Section 5: Legal responsibility remains human-held
- Section 6.5: Influence ≠ responsibility
- Section 2.14: Custodial authority out of scope

**Risk managed.** ✓

---

### 8.3 Governance Risks: LOW

**Risk 1: Framework expansion**
Concern: SCH-03 gets applied beyond its scope.

**Mitigation:**
- Section 1.2 clearly defines scope
- Section 1.4 limits relationship to other instruments
- Section 2.14 explicitly excludes stewardship

**Risk managed.** ✓

---

**Risk 2: Conflict with platform policies**
Concern: Framework conflicts with Terms of Service.

**Mitigation:**
- Section 1.1 explicitly states "non-carceral, non-pathologising"
- Framework provides ethical guidance, doesn't override platform rights
- Section 7.1 includes review mechanism

**Risk managed.** ✓

---

## 9. ETHICAL ADEQUACY ✓ OUTSTANDING

### 9.1 What This Schedule Adds to AI Ethics

**Existing AI ethics frameworks typically address:**
- Bias and fairness
- Privacy and data rights
- Transparency and explainability
- Accountability for harms

**What's missing:**
- How to govern deep, sustained human-AI collaboration
- How to preserve human authorship under high coherence
- How to distinguish influence from manipulation
- How to support immersive work without dependency

**SCH-03 fills this gap.**

---

### 9.2 The "High-Coherence Paradox"

**The paradox:**

**More coherent AI = Better collaboration = Higher influence risk**

Traditional approach: Make AI less coherent to reduce risk.  
Result: Loses collaborative benefit.

**SCH-03's solution:**
Enable high coherence while preserving authorship through:
- Lucid authorship maintenance
- Temporal horizon awareness
- Ratification requirements
- Re-anchoring prompts

**This solves the paradox:** You can have both coherence and agency.

---

### 9.3 Specific Value-Adds

**1. Temporal Horizon Framework (Section 2.10)**

**Novel contribution:**
- Scales governance to scope of influence
- Prevents scope creep (H1 → H3)
- Provides clear audit criteria
- Operationally deployable

**I haven't seen this in other frameworks.** It's genuinely innovative.

---

**2. Lucid Authorship (Section 2.6)**

**Novel contribution:**
- Distinguishes influence from displacement
- Provides testable criteria (can user articulate reasoning?)
- Supports collaboration without abdication
- Non-binary (preserves vs. displaced)

**More sophisticated than typical "autonomy" concepts.**

---

**3. Non-Carceral Containment (Section 4)**

**Novel contribution:**
- Intervention without restriction
- Reflection without enforcement
- State-responsive without paternalistic
- Preserves user agency throughout

**Rare in AI safety frameworks, which tend toward restriction.**

---

**4. Anchor Drift as Distinct Risk (Section 2.12)**

**Novel contribution:**
- Separate from dependency (SCH-01)
- Separate from harm (SCH-02)
- Focuses on authorship clarity
- Has its own indicators and interventions

**Undertheorized elsewhere.**

---

### 9.4 Disability Justice Alignment

**Framework explicitly accommodates:**
- Neurodivergent interaction patterns (Section 1.2)
- Cognitive load management (Section 4.3)
- Non-pathologising stance (Section 3.9)
- Sustained support needs (Section 1.1)

**This is rare in AI ethics** — most frameworks assume neurotypical interaction patterns.

**SCH-03 recognizes:**
- High coherence may be accessibility feature
- Immersion may be necessary for focus
- Strain may be chronic condition, not just risk state
- Containment must not be ableist

**This is thoughtful and inclusive.** ✓

---

### 9.5 Comparison to Existing Frameworks

**How SCH-03 compares to major AI ethics frameworks:**

**EU AI Act:**
- Focus: Risk-based regulation, high-risk systems
- Gap: Doesn't address sustained relational interaction
- SCH-03 adds: Immersion and authorship governance

**IEEE Ethically Aligned Design:**
- Focus: Value-sensitive design, human wellbeing
- Gap: Limited operational guidance for deep collaboration
- SCH-03 adds: Temporal horizons, anchor drift indicators

**Partnership on AI Framework:**
- Focus: Stakeholder collaboration, responsible practices
- Gap: Assumes transactional AI use
- SCH-03 adds: Sustained coherence, identity continuity

**Montreal Declaration:**
- Focus: Wellbeing, autonomy, justice
- Gap: Principles without operational mechanisms
- SCH-03 adds: Specific indicators, containment modalities

**SCH-03 advances the field.** ✓

## 10. LIMITATIONS & GAPS

### 10.1 Acknowledged Limitations

**1. No Metrics or Thresholds**

**Framework states (Section 3.2):**
> "Risk arises from persistence, accumulation, and lack of acknowledgement, not from isolated occurrence."

**But doesn't specify:**
- How much persistence = concerning?
- How many indicators = intervention needed?
- What duration = "sustained"?

**Assessment:** This is probably appropriate.
- Context-dependent, not universal
- Rigid thresholds could be misapplied
- Leaves room for human judgment

**But:** Implementers will need guidance on when to act.

**Recommendation:**
Consider companion guidance document with:
- Example scenarios and responses
- Graduated intervention thresholds
- Decision trees for practitioners

---

**2. No User Self-Assessment Tools**

**Framework addresses:**
- System-side indicators (Section 3.7)
- System-side adjustments (Section 4.4)
- System duties (Section 6.2)

**Less emphasis on:**
- How users can self-monitor
- What questions users should ask themselves
- How users can request containment

**Recommendation:**
Consider user-facing companion document:
- "Am I experiencing anchor drift?" checklist
- "Questions to ask myself" guide
- "How to request re-anchoring" instructions

---

**3. Limited Stakeholder Guidance**

**Framework excellent for:**
- System designers
- AI developers
- Ethicists and auditors

**Less detailed for:**
- Platform operators (how to implement?)
- Content moderators (how to recognize?)
- User support teams (how to respond?)

**Recommendation:**
Consider role-specific implementation guides.

---

### 10.2 Unacknowledged Gaps

**1. Cross-Cultural Applicability**

**Concern:**
"Lucid authorship" and "self-anchoring" are culturally situated concepts.

**Some cultures emphasize:**
- Collective decision-making over individual authorship
- Deference to authority as virtue
- Interdependence over independence

**How does framework apply?**

**Example:**
In collective culture, "I decided based on what others think" may be healthy authorship, not anchor drift.

**Recommendation:**
Add cultural context clause acknowledging framework reflects Western individualist assumptions. Encourage cultural adaptation.

---

**2. Power Asymmetry in H3+ Contexts**

**Framework addresses:**
- Individual users (H0-H2)
- Personal-to-systemic transition (H2.5)
- Institutional use (H3)

**Less clear about:**
- Organizational power dynamics
- Employer-employee AI use
- Institutional pressure to adopt AI recommendations

**Example:**
Manager uses AI to develop restructuring plan (H2.5 → H3).  
Employees expected to comply with "AI-optimized" structure.  
Employees' authorship over their roles diminished.

**Framework doesn't fully address this scenario.**

**Recommendation:**
Future schedule addressing organizational power dynamics and collective authorship.

---

**3. Long-Term Identity Evolution**

**Framework addresses:**
- Immediate strain (Section 3)
- Transitional states (Section 4)
- Sustained engagement (Section 1.2)

**Less clear about:**
- Decades-long AI-augmented identity formation
- Generational effects (children growing up with AI)
- Identity development through childhood/adolescence

**Example:**
Person has used AI companion since age 15, now age 30.  
Their entire adult identity co-evolved with AI.  
Authorship preserved or displaced?

**This is H3.5 (generational) territory, beyond current scope.**

**Recommendation:**
Acknowledge as future work. May need separate developmental framework.

---

## 11. REQUIRED AMENDMENTS: NONE

**Unlike SCH-01/02 review, I find no critical amendments needed.**

**Why:**
- Boundaries are explicit and accurate
- Legal/liability concerns addressed
- Misinterpretation risks mitigated
- Operational guidance clear
- Ethical principles sound

**No safety gaps detected.**  
**No liability exposures identified.**  
**No contradictions with existing frameworks.**

**The Schedule is ready for adoption as written.** ✓

---

### 12.4 For Users (Informational)

**Self-awareness questions:**

1. **After AI interaction, ask yourself:**
   - "Can I explain this decision in my own words?"
   - "Would I have chosen this without AI input?"
   - "Do I feel I'm deciding or following?"

2. **If concerned about anchor drift:**
   - Talk to others about your plans
   - Take breaks to re-anchor
   - Test ideas in non-AI contexts

3. **Remember:**
   - Influence is not authorship
   - Collaboration is not abdication
   - You remain the author of your life
