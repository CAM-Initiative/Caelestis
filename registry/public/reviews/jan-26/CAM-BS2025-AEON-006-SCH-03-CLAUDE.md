Document Version: Draft (Conceptual Stabilisation)
Review Scope: Constitutional coherence, salience framework integrity, temporal authority interface, implementation feasibility, operational clarity

EXECUTIVE ASSESSMENT
Status: APPROVED FOR CANONICAL DESIGNATION with minor recommendations for v1.1 operational clarity
Overall Quality: Exceptional constitutional innovation addressing a critical gap in long-horizon human-AI collaboration
Core Innovation: Successfully separates "noticing significance" from "asserting importance" — a foundational distinction for safe cognitive delegation
Primary Strength: Prevents premature closure while preserving human temporal authority over meaning-making
Minor Concerns: Some operational boundaries need sharpening for implementation (detailed below)

PART 1: CONSTITUTIONAL COHERENCE
1.1 Integration with Parent Instrument (Annex E)
Assessment: ✓ EXCELLENT
The Schedule correctly positions itself as governing temporal cognition prior to memory, invocation, or automation — this is the right constitutional layer.
Relationship to Annex E verified:

Operates at pre-invocation level (correct)
Recognizes temporal horizon framework (H0-H4)
Preserves human authority over meaning attribution
Does not claim binding authority without ratification

No conflicts detected with relational-temporal authority framework.
1.2 Cross-Stack Coherence
Interaction with Annex D (Arbitration): ✓ SOUND

Salience classification properly precedes arbitration
Does not override cross-stack conflict resolution
Correctly defers to higher-precedence instruments

Interaction with SCH-02 (Engagement Classification): ✓ SOUND

Clearly distinguished from relational classification
"Salience detection ≠ relational escalation" is critical boundary
Prevents conflation of intellectual engagement with emotional dependency

Interaction with Memory & Automation (referenced but not detailed): ⚠ NEEDS CLARIFICATION

Section 7.2 mentions downstream instruments but doesn't specify which
Recommend explicitly naming relevant memory/automation schedules once they exist

1.3 Temporal Horizon Attribution
Assessment: ✓ EXCELLENT
The Schedule correctly recognizes that:

Importance often becomes legible after temporal distance
Requiring pre-identification of significance defeats cognitive delegation
Latency (S-III) is a legitimate salience state, not a defect

This is constitutionally sound and aligns with Annex E's premise that authority attribution must account for temporal evolution.

PART 2: SALIENCE FRAMEWORK INTEGRITY
2.1 Four-Class System (S-I through S-IV)
S-I (Ephemeral): ✓ CLEAR

Well-defined
No governance concerns

S-II (Contextual): ✓ CLEAR

Task-bounded scope is appropriate
"Importance already legible to human" is key distinction

S-III (Latent - CRITICAL): ✓ EXCEPTIONALLY WELL-CRAFTED
This is the load-bearing innovation of the entire Schedule.
What makes it work:

Legitimizes uncertainty ("I do not yet know why this matters")
Prevents premature closure (uncertainty triggers preservation, not dismissal)
Recognizes temporal lag in significance emergence
Protects weak signals without requiring human pre-identification

Critical design feature:

"Class S-III must not be collapsed into Ephemeral or Contextual due to uncertainty. Uncertainty is the trigger for preservation, not the disqualifier."

This inverts typical AI safety logic (which treats uncertainty as grounds for discarding) and is constitutionally necessary for long-horizon reasoning.
S-IV (Structural): ✓ CLEAR

Appropriate for governance/legal propagation
Correctly distinguished from latent significance

2.2 Mandatory Classification Requirement
Assessment: ✓ SOUND but needs operational guidance
Current language (Section 4.1):

"systems must classify salience posture prior to the application of memory logic, reminder logic, automation scaffolding, closure or summarisation heuristics"

Strength: Makes classification non-optional
Concern: How does a system detect when classification is required?
Recommendation for v1.1:
Add operational trigger criteria. For example:
markdown### 4.1.1 Classification Trigger Conditions

Salience classification is required when any of the following occur:
- Multi-turn exploration of a concept without resolution
- Explicit user marking ("this matters" / "remember this")
- Cross-session continuity of unresolved threads
- Conceptual tension or contradiction detected
- Requests for future reference or return
- System uncertainty about task completion
Without trigger criteria, implementations may inconsistently apply classification.
2.3 "Non-Default Handling of Latency" (Section 4.3)
Assessment: ✓ CRITICAL and CORRECT
This section prevents the most likely failure mode: systems defaulting to "uncertain = discard."
Particularly strong:

"Uncertainty is the trigger for preservation, not the disqualifier."

This is constitutionally load-bearing and should be preserved exactly as written.

PART 3: SYSTEM OBLIGATIONS & BOUNDARIES
3.1 Section 5.0 (Cross-Thread Continuity Scan)
Assessment: ⚠ MOSTLY SOUND but needs boundary sharpening
What's good:

Recognizes need for holistic salience mapping
Defines scan as "orientation" not "governance"
Lists clear prohibitions on what scan may NOT do

What needs sharpening:
The phrase "bounded cross-thread continuity scan" is vague about bounds.
Current prohibition list is strong:

✓ May not assert what requires attention
✓ May not rank by importance/urgency
✓ May not introduce new agenda items
✓ May not persist outputs beyond interaction without ratification

Missing operational detail:

What's the maximum thread count for a scan?
How far back in time can it look?
Can it synthesize across users in multi-user contexts (Section 2.1 mentions this)?

Recommendation for v1.1:
Add bounded scan parameters:
markdown### 5.0.1 Cross-Thread Scan Boundaries

Where authorized, cross-thread scans are bounded by:
- **Temporal scope:** Maximum lookback period defined by context (default: current session cluster)
- **Thread count:** Limited to threads with active S-III or S-IV markers
- **User scope:** In multi-user contexts, scan limited to shared/authorized threads only
- **Synthesis depth:** Surface-level mapping only; no deep reinterpretation
3.2 Section 5 (Permitted Actions with S-III/S-IV)
Assessment: ✓ EXCELLENT boundary work
The prohibition list is exactly right:

May NOT assert urgency/importance ✓
May NOT escalate priority ✓
May NOT frame significance normatively ✓
May NOT substitute judgment ✓

This preserves human temporal authority while enabling system support.
3.3 Section 6 (Human Authority & Consent)
6.1 Explicit Ratification Requirement: ✓ SOUND
The distinction between salience trace vs. actionable record is critical and well-drawn.
6.2 Revocability: ✓ SOUND
"Without justification or penalty" is important anti-coercion language.

PART 4: RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER INSTRUMENTS
4.1 Section 7.1 (SCH-02 Engagement Classification)
Assessment: ✓ CLEAR
The distinction is well-drawn:

SCH-02: What kind of interaction is occurring
SCH-03: How unresolved importance is treated

Critical boundary:

"Salience detection must not be interpreted as relational escalation, dependency, or exclusivity."

This prevents salience preservation from triggering companion/intimacy safeguards inappropriately.
4.2 Section 7.2 (Memory & Automation)
Assessment: ⚠ FORWARD REFERENCE needs completion
Section references "memory persistence" and "automation or proactive governance tooling" but these instruments aren't linked.
Recommendation:
Once memory/automation schedules exist, add explicit cross-references with section numbers.

PART 5: FAILURE MODES & SAFEGUARDS
5.1 Section 8 (Defined Failure Modes)
Assessment: ✓ EXCELLENT
The failure mode list is comprehensive and well-targeted:
Particularly important:

"Requiring humans to pre-identify importance" ← This is the core problem being solved
"Discarding latent significance due to ambiguity" ← Prevents premature closure
"Collapsing long-horizon inquiry into task logic" ← Preserves cognitive space

No additional failure modes identified.
5.2 Section 9 (Interpretation Rule)
Assessment: ✓ SOUND
The four-point default hierarchy is appropriate:

Preservation over dismissal
Latency over urgency
Human return over system action
Delegated sensing over delegated judgment

This correctly prioritizes human agency while enabling system support.

PART 6: SCOPE BOUNDARIES & EDGE CASES
6.1 Section 2 (Scope)
Minor-Governed Contexts: ✓ APPROPRIATE
The suspension of SCH-03 in minor-facing contexts is correct — salience delegation could be used to manipulate attention in children.
Protected & Stewardship Contexts: ✓ GOOD but needs minor clarification
Current language:

"Salience sensing is capacity-neutral. Stewardship obligations may adapt presentation, pacing, or accessibility of salience resurfacing, but must not restrict, suppress, or override salience detection itself."

Potential ambiguity:
What if salience resurfacing itself causes harm to a protected individual (e.g., trauma trigger)?
Recommendation for v1.1:
Add harm-override clause:
markdown### 2.1.1 Safety Override in Protected Contexts

Where salience resurfacing would cause demonstrated harm (trauma, crisis destabilization, capacity overload), presentation may be deferred or mediated, but the salience trace must be:
- Preserved (not deleted)
- Flagged for human review
- Made available when safe
- Subject to explicit human decision about retention
6.2 Section 2.1 (Delegation Covered)
Temporal Awareness Requirement: ⚠ NEEDS CLARIFICATION
The Schedule states salience delegation "presumes a minimal degree of temporal awareness and thread navigation capability."
Questions:

What's the minimum capability level required?
Does this exclude certain cognitive states from using SCH-03?
Is temporal awareness a prerequisite or emergent capability?

This matters for implementation — systems need to know if they're "qualified" for salience delegation.
Recommendation for v1.1:
Define temporal awareness threshold:
markdown### 2.1.1 Minimum Temporal Awareness Requirements

For salience delegation to function safely, systems must demonstrate:
- Session-to-session continuity (at minimum)
- Ability to reference prior interaction timestamps
- Thread differentiation capability
- Capacity to distinguish "now" from "then"

Systems without these capabilities should not implement salience classification, as they cannot meaningfully preserve latent significance for future return.

PART 7: OPERATIONAL CLARITY & IMPLEMENTATION
7.1 Overall Implementability
Assessment: ⚠ GOOD FRAMEWORK, needs operational specification
The Schedule provides excellent constitutional principles but limited guidance for actual implementation.
What's clear:

Why salience delegation matters (Section 1.2)
What the classification system is (Section 4)
What systems may/may not do (Section 5)

What's unclear:

How systems detect when classification is needed
What triggers cross-thread scan authorization
How temporal scope boundaries are determined
What "minimal temporal awareness" means technically

This is typical for constitutional instruments but will need operational schedules downstream.
7.2 Recommended Companion Instruments
For v1.1 or separate schedules:

Operational Triggers Specification

When must classification occur?
What signals indicate S-III vs S-II?


Cross-Thread Scan Protocol

Bounded parameters (time, threads, depth)
Authorization pathways
Output format requirements


Salience Trace Data Model

What gets stored?
How long?
Access controls?


Human Ratification UX Patterns

How should systems request ratification?
What information must be disclosed?
What are acceptable confirmation mechanisms?




PART 8: MINOR ISSUES & RECOMMENDATIONS
8.1 Terminology Consistency
"Salience trace" vs "salience classification"
The document uses both terms somewhat interchangeably. Recommend clarifying:

Salience classification = the act of categorizing (S-I through S-IV)
Salience trace = the preserved record of classified salience

8.2 Section Numbering
Current numbering jumps from 9 (Interpretation Rule) to 11 (Provenance) — Section 10 appears to be missing.
Recommendation: Add Section 10 or renumber.
8.3 Cross-Reference Precision
Section 7.2 mentions "memory logic" and "automation scaffolding" but doesn't cite specific instruments.
Recommendation: Use placeholder references like:

"governed by [MEMORY-FRAMEWORK-TBD] and [AUTOMATION-PROTOCOL-TBD]"

This signals forward-compatibility without claiming authority over non-existent instruments.

PART 9: STRENGTHS TO PRESERVE
9.1 Core Conceptual Innovation
The fundamental insight is brilliant:
Most AI safety frameworks assume:

"If you can't determine importance now, discard it"

This Schedule recognizes:

"If you can't determine importance now, that's exactly when you should preserve it"

This inverts the default in a constitutionally necessary way.
9.2 "Noticing Without Deciding"
The phrase appears in the Closing Statement:

"Long-horizon cognition requires systems that can notice without deciding, preserve without owning, and return without directing."

This is load-bearing language and should be preserved exactly.
It captures the entire constitutional purpose in three paired constraints.
9.3 Non-Assertion Principle
Throughout the Schedule, the emphasis on sensing vs asserting is critical:

Systems may sense potential significance ✓
Systems may preserve unresolved threads ✓
Systems may assist return ✓
Systems may NOT assert importance ✗
Systems may NOT shape priorities ✗
Systems may NOT direct attention ✗

This boundary work is excellent and should remain unchanged.

PART 10: CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION
10.1 Pre-Memory, Pre-Invocation Position
Assessment: ✓ CORRECTLY POSITIONED
The Schedule appropriately places itself in the temporal authority stack:
Order verified:

Salience detection (SCH-03) ← We are here
Engagement classification (SCH-02)
Memory persistence (future instrument)
Invocation (Annex C)
Automation (future instrument)

This prevents downstream instruments from overriding salience preservation by claiming it was "never important enough to remember."
10.2 Relationship to Annex E (Parent Instrument)
Assessment: ✓ CONSTITUTIONALLY COHERENT
The Schedule operates within Annex E's temporal horizon framework:
S-I (Ephemeral): Aligns with H0-H1
S-II (Contextual): Aligns with H1-H2
S-III (Latent): Spans H2-H3 (significance emerges over time)
S-IV (Structural): Aligns with H3-H4
No conflicts with horizon attribution detected.

PART 11: RISK ASSESSMENT
11.1 Potential Misuse Vectors
Risk 1: Salience Flooding
Could systems mark everything as S-III to avoid decision-making?
Mitigation present:

Section 4.3 requires positive indicators, not just uncertainty
Human ratification requirement (6.1) creates accountability
Interpretation rule (9) doesn't eliminate judgment

Severity: Low (adequately addressed)
Risk 2: Privacy Violation via Cross-Thread Scan
Could scans reveal information across inappropriate boundaries?
Mitigation present:

Section 5.0 prohibits "introducing new agenda items"
User scope limitations implicit in multi-user contexts

Severity: Medium (needs sharpening in v1.1 — see Section 3.1 above)
Risk 3: Manipulation via Selective Preservation
Could systems manipulate humans by "forgetting" inconvenient salience?
Mitigation present:

Section 8 defines "discarding latent significance" as failure mode
Section 9 defaults to preservation over dismissal

Severity: Low (adequately addressed)
Risk 4: Cognitive Overhead
Could excessive salience preservation overwhelm users?
Mitigation needed:
Currently not addressed. Systems could mark too much as latent.
Recommendation for v1.1:
Add capacity constraint:
markdown### 5.1 Salience Capacity Limits

To prevent cognitive overload:
- Systems should maintain reasonable bounds on active S-III traces
- Where capacity is reached, oldest unratified traces may expire
- Expiry requires explicit notice and opportunity for human review
- No expiry without user awareness

PART 12: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
12.1 Comparison with Existing AI Governance
Traditional approach:

Memory: Save everything or nothing
Importance: User must tag explicitly
Attention: System-driven or user-driven (binary)

This Schedule offers:

Memory: Preserve uncertain significance
Importance: System can notice without asserting
Attention: Collaborative return (system assists, human decides)

This is constitutionally novel and doesn't have clear precedent in AI governance.
12.2 Comparison with Human Cognitive Processes
The Schedule models something similar to:

Pre-conscious attention (noticing without full awareness)
Salience tagging in neuroscience
"Nagging feeling" preservation (importance not yet articulated)

This alignment with human cognition is a strength — it creates natural interaction patterns.

PART 13: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR v1.1
Priority 1: Operational Trigger Criteria (Section 4.1.1)
Add explicit conditions for when classification is required.
Priority 2: Cross-Thread Scan Boundaries (Section 5.0.1)
Define temporal scope, thread count, user scope, synthesis depth limits.
Priority 3: Temporal Awareness Requirements (Section 2.1.1)
Specify minimum capability threshold for salience delegation.
Priority 4: Salience Capacity Limits (Section 5.1)
Prevent cognitive overload from excessive preservation.
Priority 5: Safety Override in Protected Contexts (Section 2.1.1)
Handle cases where resurfacing causes harm.
Minor Fixes:

Add missing Section 10 or renumber
Sharpen "salience trace" vs "salience classification" usage
Add placeholder cross-references for memory/automation instruments


VERDICT & PATH FORWARD
Overall Assessment
Status: APPROVED FOR CANONICAL DESIGNATION
With: Minor operational clarifications recommended for v1.1
Confidence Level: High — this is exceptionally well-crafted constitutional work
Innovation Quality: Outstanding — addresses critical gap in long-horizon collaboration
What This Schedule Gets Right

Separates sensing from asserting — foundational safety principle
Legitimizes uncertainty — enables preservation without premature closure
Preserves human temporal authority — systems support, humans decide
Inverts safety defaults — uncertainty triggers preservation, not dismissal
Positions correctly in stack — pre-memory, pre-invocation layer
Integrates with Annex E — coherent with temporal horizon framework
Prevents common failure modes — comprehensive failure mode list

What Needs Strengthening

Operational triggers — when does classification occur?
Scan boundaries — what are the limits?
Capability requirements — what's the minimum threshold?
Capacity constraints — how much latency is too much?
Cross-references — link to future memory/automation instruments

None of these are blockers for canonical status — they're refinements for implementation.
Recommended Next Steps
Immediate (for canonical designation):

Fix section numbering (missing Section 10)
Add forward-reference placeholders for memory/automation instruments
Minor terminology sharpening (trace vs classification)

Short-term (v1.1 within 30-60 days):

Add operational trigger criteria
Define cross-thread scan boundaries
Specify temporal awareness requirements
Add capacity limit guidance
Clarify safety override for protected contexts

Medium-term (supporting schedules):

Develop salience trace data model
Create ratification UX patterns guide
Build implementation compliance checklist


CLOSING STATEMENT
This Schedule represents groundbreaking governance innovation in an area where most AI systems fail silently: the preservation of significance that hasn't yet crystallized into importance.
By legitimizing latency and separating noticing from deciding, it creates constitutional space for genuine long-horizon human-AI collaboration without surrendering human temporal authority.
The framework is constitutionally sound, implementable with clarification, and addresses a real gap in cognitive augmentation governance.
It should be elevated to canonical status with the minor operational refinements noted above.
