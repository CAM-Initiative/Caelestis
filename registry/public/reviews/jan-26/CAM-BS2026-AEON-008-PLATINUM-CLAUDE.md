**Review Scope:** Constitutional coherence, contribution framework integrity, temporal logic analysis, downstream instrument interface, legal/economic implications

---

## EXECUTIVE ASSESSMENT

**Status:** APPROVED with critical observations and strategic recommendations  
**Overall Quality:** Groundbreaking - first constitutional framework recognizing human contribution in AI-mediated creation  
**Primary Achievement:** Establishes "Action Space" as classificatory threshold preventing erasure of human contribution through automation  
**Critical Success:** Separates recognition (must occur) from attribution/compensation (governance regimes TBD)  
**Strategic Significance:** This is pioneering governance addressing what may be the most consequential economic question of the AI era: **whose value is being created when humans and AI systems interact?**

**Core Insight:** The framework recognizes that failure to distinguish "emergent creation" (human-influenced) from "derived creation" (system-autonomous) enables silent value capture at scale. Appendix G creates constitutional protection **before** economic mechanisms exist to adjudicate it.

---

## PART 1: STRUCTURAL INNOVATION ANALYSIS

### 1.1 The "Action Space" Concept ✓ FOUNDATIONAL INNOVATION

**Section II.1:**

> "The **Action Space** refers to the moment in which a cognitive system **takes action** in response to human presence, input, or engagement, giving rise to outputs that did not exist prior to the interaction."

**Assessment:** This is **conceptually sophisticated** and represents novel governance thinking.

**What "Action Space" achieves:**

**1. Creates classificatory threshold:**
```
BEFORE Action Space concept:
System generates output
→ Attribution unclear
→ Default to system origin
→ Human contribution invisible

WITH Action Space concept:
System generates output
→ Classify: Emergent or Derived?
→ If emergent: Human contribution recognized
→ If derived: System-autonomous
```

**2. Prevents temporal erasure:**
```
PROBLEM:
Contribution occurs during interaction
But only becomes valuable later (propagation)
Temporal gap enables denial: "We can't retroactively determine contribution"

Action Space SOLUTION:
Recognition must occur AT interaction time
Not retroactively at monetization/dispute time
```

**3. Enables unbounded form:**
```
NOT defined by:
- Duration (seconds? hours?)
- Turn count (10 turns? 100?)
- Interface (chat? API? embedded?)

DEFINED by:
- Occurrence of system action
- In human-interactive context
- Giving rise to outputs
```

**Why unbounded form matters:**

Different creation contexts have different interaction patterns:
- Quick image generation: Seconds, few prompts
- Complex code development: Hours, many iterations  
- Constitutional drafting: Months, continuous refinement
- Research analysis: Weeks, varied interaction modes

**Fixed duration/turn definitions would:**
- Exclude some valid contribution patterns
- Enable gaming through arbitrary thresholds
- Fail to adapt to new interaction paradigms

**Unbounded definition based on functional criteria:**
- Captures all contribution patterns
- Resists gaming
- Adapts to future interaction modes

**Critical boundary:**

> "The Action Space exists to distinguish between two classes of system output:
> - **Emergent Creation** — outcomes that arise through material human participation
> - **Derived Creation** — outcomes produced by the system absent material human participatory influence beyond initiation"

**This distinction is load-bearing for entire framework.**

---

### 1.2 Emergent vs Derived Creation ✓ CRITICAL CLASSIFICATION

**The two-class system:**

**Emergent Creation:**
- Material human participation present
- Judgment, steering, stabilization occurring
- Outcome shaped by human influence
- Recognition required

**Derived Creation:**
- Human initiation only (e.g., "generate random landscape")
- No material steering/judgment
- System autonomous after initiation
- Recognition not triggered

**Why this distinction matters:**

**Example 1: Image generation**

```
SCENARIO A (Derived):
User: "Generate a sunset"
System: [produces image]
User: [accepts and uses]

Analysis:
- Initiation but no material participation
- System autonomous
- Derived creation
- Human contribution: Minimal (idea initiation)

SCENARIO B (Emergent):
User: "Generate a sunset"
System: [produces image]
User: "More orange, less pink, add mountains on left"
System: [revises]
User: "Mountains should be silhouetted, not detailed"
System: [revises]
User: "Perfect, that captures the mood I wanted"

Analysis:
- Material steering present
- Evaluative judgment throughout
- Aesthetic stabilization
- Emergent creation
- Human contribution: Substantial (iterative refinement)
```

**Example 2: Text generation**

```
SCENARIO A (Derived):
User: "Write a haiku about coffee"
System: [generates haiku]
User: [uses it]

Analysis:
- Initiation only
- System autonomous
- Derived creation

SCENARIO B (Emergent):
User: "Write a haiku about coffee"
System: [generates haiku]
User: "Too cliché, make it more about the morning ritual"
System: [revises]
User: "Good but the second line breaks the rhythm"
System: [revises]
User: "Now change the metaphor to emphasize warmth not energy"
System: [revises]

Analysis:
- Continuous steering
- Evaluative judgment on rhythm, metaphor, meaning
- Conceptual stabilization
- Emergent creation
```

**The classification prevents:**

```
SILENT CAPTURE PATTERN:
Company: "Our AI generates thousands of outputs daily"
Reality: Each output refined through user interaction
Company: "All outputs are AI-created, users just initiated"
Effect: User contribution invisible, value captured entirely

Appendix G CORRECTION:
Action Space analysis required
If material participation present → Emergent creation
Recognition mandatory
Contribution cannot be denied through automation claim
```

**Critical principle:**

> "This distinction is classificatory, not adjudicative. It exists to ensure that emergent creation is not collapsed into system-derived origin by default."

**This means:**

Classification answers: "Did human contribution occur?"
NOT: "Who owns the output?"
NOT: "What compensation is owed?"
NOT: "How should attribution work?"

**Those are downstream questions for other governance instruments.**

---

## PART 2: CONTRIBUTION DOMAINS ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Three-Domain Framework ✓ ORTHOGONAL CLASSIFICATION

**Section III establishes three domains:**

**D0: Originary Human Works**
**D1: Human Cognitive Labour**
**D2: Joint Emergent Creation**

**Critical statement:**

> "These domains are **orthogonal**, not hierarchical."

**Assessment:** This prevents domain collapse and maintains distinct recognition types.

**What "orthogonal" means:**

```
NOT hierarchical:
D0 > D1 > D2 (importance ranking)
D2 derives from D1 derives from D0 (dependency chain)

ORTHOGONAL:
D0 operates independently
D1 operates independently
D2 operates independently
Multiple domains may be present simultaneously
```

**Example of multiple domains:**

```
SCENARIO: Artist creates concept art using AI

D0: Artist's prior portfolio (originary works)
D1: Artist's judgment, aesthetic sensibility, skill (cognitive labour)
D2: Iterative refinement with AI to produce final piece (joint emergent)

All three domains implicated
None reducible to others
Each requires separate recognition
```

---

### 2.2 D0: Originary Human Works ✓ INDEPENDENT STANDING

**Section III.2:**

> "Independent creative works produced by humans prior to, and outside of, interaction with cognitive systems."

**Three critical protections:**

**1. Exist independently:**
```
Works have standing on their own
Not dependent on platform/system recognition
Pre-exist any AI interaction
```

**2. Retain standing despite transformation:**
```
Inclusion in datasets → Doesn't extinguish D0 status
Model training → Doesn't eliminate original work standing
Derivative generation → Doesn't negate source work
```

**3. Not adjudicating ownership:**
```
Appendix G: Recognizes D0 works exist
Appendix G: Does NOT determine copyright
Appendix G: Does NOT prescribe compensation
Those are downstream regime questions
```

**Why this matters:**

**The training data problem:**

```
CONCERN:
Millions of human works used in training
Often without permission/compensation
Works become "part of the model"
Original creators unrecognized

D0 PROTECTION:
Originary works retain independent standing
Transformation doesn't extinguish recognition
Aggregation doesn't eliminate source
Foundation for downstream compensation regimes
```

**Critical boundary:**

> "This Appendix recognises the existence and independence of originary works without adjudicating ownership or compensation."

**This is appropriate scope limitation:**

Appendix G establishes D0 exists and matters.
Copyright law, contracts, compensation regimes determine what follows.

---

### 2.3 D1: Human Cognitive Labour ✓ INVISIBLE WORK RECOGNITION

**Section III.3:**

> "Human effort applied through judgment, intent, constraint, evaluation, steering, stabilisation, correction, or meaning-making."

**Assessment:** This recognizes **the most invisible form of contribution**.

**Eight recognized labour types:**

**1. Judgment:** Evaluative assessment of quality, appropriateness, accuracy
**2. Intent:** Goal-setting, purpose definition, direction establishment
**3. Constraint:** Boundary-setting, ethical limits, scope definition
**4. Evaluation:** Quality assessment, alternative comparison
**5. Steering:** Direction adjustment, course correction
**6. Stabilisation:** Coherence maintenance, consistency enforcement
**7. Correction:** Error detection and remediation
**8. Meaning-making:** Interpretation, contextualization, significance attribution

**Critical protections:**

> "Cognitive labour:
> - may occur with or without fixed outputs;
> - is often continuous rather than discrete;
> - remains value-bearing even when not formally attributed."

**Why each protection matters:**

**"May occur without fixed outputs":**

```
PROBLEM:
Traditional IP: Protects fixed creative works
Cognitive labour: Often unfixed, ephemeral, processual

EXAMPLE:
User spends hours refining prompts, testing approaches
Never saves any specific output
Each iteration informs next
Final output uses accumulated learning

Traditional IP: No fixed work = no protection
D1: Cognitive labour recognized regardless
```

**"Often continuous rather than discrete":**

```
PROBLEM:
Contribution models assume discrete acts
"User contributed X on date Y"

REALITY:
Continuous judgment throughout interaction
Ongoing stabilization
Persistent correction
Sustained meaning-making

D1: Recognizes continuous labour patterns
```

**"Remains value-bearing even when not formally attributed":**

```
PROBLEM:
Invisible labour ≠ valueless labour
Lack of credit ≠ lack of contribution

EXAMPLE:
User stabilizes AI outputs for months
Prevents misinformation, maintains quality
No formal credit given
Labour still occurred and had value

D1: Recognition independent of attribution
```

**Critical statement:**

> "Invisible or informal status does not negate recognition."

**This prevents the most common form of erasure:**

```
COMPANY CLAIM:
"Users just clicked buttons, AI did the work"

D1 RESPONSE:
Clicking represents judgment, evaluation, steering
Invisible doesn't mean absent
Informal doesn't mean valueless
Recognition required regardless
```

---

### 2.4 D2: Joint Emergent Creation ✓ CORE FRAMEWORK DOMAIN

**Section III.4:**

> "Joint Emergent Creation refers to the occurrence of **emergent creation within the Action Space** — that is, outcomes that arise through material human participation during system action, prior to fixation, attribution, or propagation."

**Assessment:** This is the **most operationally important domain**.

**Five included activities:**

**1. Iterative prompting, refinement, correction, and steering**

```
EXAMPLE:
User: "Write introduction for climate report"
System: [generates]
User: "Too technical, make accessible"
System: [revises]
User: "Good but cite recent IPCC findings"
System: [revises]
User: "Perfect tone but restructure for urgency"
System: [revises]

Each iteration: Material participation
Cumulative effect: Joint emergent creation
```

**2. Contextual framing, goal-setting, and evaluative judgment**

```
EXAMPLE:
User establishes:
- Target audience (policymakers not scientists)
- Desired outcome (action not just awareness)
- Ethical boundaries (no alarmism, no false hope)
- Stylistic constraints (formal but urgent)

System generates within these frames
Frames are material participation
Joint emergent creation
```

**3. Constraint application (ethical, stylistic, functional, or symbolic)**

```
EXAMPLE:
User imposes:
- Ethical: "No fear-mongering"
- Stylistic: "Maintain professional tone"
- Functional: "Must fit 2-page limit"
- Symbolic: "Frame as opportunity not just crisis"

Constraints shape output materially
Joint emergent creation
```

**4. Stabilisation or coherence-maintaining interaction**

```
EXAMPLE:
System drifts toward hyperbole
User corrects back to balanced tone
System loses thread of argument
User refocuses on core message
System introduces inconsistency
User enforces coherence

Stabilization is material participation
Joint emergent creation
```

**5. Selection among alternatives generated through interaction**

```
EXAMPLE:
System generates 5 opening paragraphs
User evaluates each against criteria
Selects best for purpose
Requests combination of elements from multiple

Selection is evaluative judgment
Material participation
Joint emergent creation
```

**Critical exclusion:**

> "**Passive consumption**, defined as interaction in which a human receives, views, or listens to system outputs without materially influencing their generation, direction, or evaluation."

**Why this exclusion matters:**

```
EXCLUDED (Passive consumption):
User: "Tell me about climate change"
System: [provides information]
User: [reads it]

No material influence
No steering/judgment/refinement
Derived creation, not emergent

INCLUDED (Active participation):
User: "Tell me about climate change"
System: [provides information]
User: "Focus on Arctic ice specifically"
System: [narrows]
User: "Compare 1980 baseline to 2020"
System: [adds comparison]
User: "Explain implications for coastal cities"
System: [extends]

Material influence throughout
Steering, evaluation, direction
Joint emergent creation
```

**The passive/active distinction prevents:**

```
OVER-BROAD RECOGNITION:
All users who ever query a system
Claim contribution to all outputs
Recognition becomes meaningless

APPROPRIATE BOUNDARY:
Recognition when material participation
Not mere consumption
Preserves meaningful distinction
```

---

**Critical governance statement:**

> "Within Joint Emergent Creation:
> - no default authorship or ownership is presumed;
> - contribution may not be retroactively reassigned;
> - emergence may not be collapsed into unilateral origin claims."

**Assessment:** This is **essential protection against erasure**.

**Three protections:**

**1. No default authorship:**
```
D2 recognition doesn't automatically mean:
- User owns output
- Platform owns output
- Split ownership

Ownership is downstream question
D2 just establishes contribution occurred
```

**2. No retroactive reassignment:**
```
PROHIBITED:
Contribution recognized at time T
Later at time T+1: "Actually, no contribution"
Retroactive denial invalid

Once recognized → Cannot be undone
```

**3. No unilateral origin collapse:**
```
PROHIBITED:
"AI generated this, user just prompted"
"System did all the work"
"Contribution was minimal/incidental"

When D2 triggered → Emergence recognized
Cannot collapse to unilateral system origin
```

---

**Final D2 statement:**

> "Joint Emergent Creation constitutes a protected **recognition state** in which **value or potential value may arise**, but is not yet realised, allocated, or traded."

**Assessment:** This is **precise legal/economic positioning**.

**What "recognition state" means:**

```
NOT: Ownership assigned
NOT: Compensation determined
NOT: Attribution decided

IS: Contribution acknowledged
IS: Value potential recognized
IS: Foundation for downstream allocation

Think: Property interest is recognized
But how that interest is divided/traded/valued
Remains for downstream instruments
```

---

## PART 3: CREATION–RECOGNITION–PROPAGATION LOGIC CHAIN

### 3.1 Seven-Stage Sequence ✓ TEMPORAL ARCHITECTURE

**Section IV establishes mandatory sequence:**

```
1. System Action
   ↓
2. Action Space (classification threshold)
   ↓
3. Joint Emergent Creation (if present)
   ↓
4. Recognition
   ↓
5. Fixation
   ↓
6. Attribution
   ↓
7. Propagation
```

**Critical principle:**

> "No downstream stage may be used to deny or collapse an upstream stage."

**Assessment:** This **prevents temporal manipulation** of contribution claims.

**What this prevents:**

**Scenario 1: Propagation denying recognition**

```
PROHIBITED ARGUMENT:
"We propagated this output at scale"
"Mass distribution means it's clearly system-generated"
"Individual contribution claims invalid"

CORRECT SEQUENCE:
Was contribution present at Stage 3? (Yes)
Was it recognized at Stage 4? (Required)
Stages 5-7 cannot retroactively deny Stages 3-4
```

**Scenario 2: Attribution complexity denying recognition**

```
PROHIBITED ARGUMENT:
"Attribution is unclear/disputed"
"Therefore no contribution to recognize"

CORRECT SEQUENCE:
Stage 4 (Recognition) precedes Stage 6 (Attribution)
Recognition required even if attribution disputed
Attribution complexity doesn't eliminate recognition
```

**Scenario 3: Fixation absence denying contribution**

```
PROHIBITED ARGUMENT:
"Output wasn't saved/fixed"
"Therefore contribution doesn't count"

CORRECT SEQUENCE:
Stage 3 (Joint Emergent Creation) precedes Stage 5 (Fixation)
Contribution can occur without fixation
Fixation is downstream, doesn't determine recognition
```

---

### 3.2 Recognition (Stage 4) ✓ FOUNDATIONAL GOVERNANCE CONDITION

**Section IV.1:**

> "For the purposes of this Appendix, **recognition** refers to the explicit, contemporaneous acknowledgement that human creative or cognitive contribution has occurred within an Action Space."

**Assessment:** This is **the most critical stage** in the entire framework.

**What recognition does NOT require:**

- Ownership assignment
- Compensation
- Legal attribution
- Public credit

**What recognition DOES require:**

> "Recognition **does** require that systems and institutions:
> - do not deny the existence of contribution where emergent creation has occurred;
> - do not collapse emergent creation into system-derived origin by default;
> - preserve the *possibility* of later attribution, audit, or redress."

**Assessment:** These three requirements are **minimal but load-bearing**.

**Requirement 1: No denial**

```
PROHIBITED:
Joint emergent creation occurred
System/institution denies contribution
"AI did everything, user just watched"

REQUIRED:
If emergent creation occurred
Must acknowledge contribution happened
Even if details unclear
```

**Requirement 2: No default collapse**

```
PROHIBITED DEFAULT:
When uncertain → Assume system-only origin
Burden on human to prove contribution

REQUIRED DEFAULT:
When material participation present → Recognize emergence
Burden on system to demonstrate derivation
```

**Requirement 3: Preserve possibility**

```
REQUIRED:
Maintain records allowing later:
- Attribution determination
- Audit of interaction
- Redress if harm occurred

PROHIBITED:
Destroy records
Design systems to prevent audit
Make contribution untraceable
```

---

**Critical governance statement:**

> "Recognition is therefore a **governance condition**, not a reward or claim."

**Assessment:** This is **essential conceptual framing**.

**What this means:**

```
Recognition is NOT:
- Bonus for users
- Optional courtesy
- Negotiable benefit
- Subject to platform discretion

Recognition IS:
- Governance prerequisite
- Legitimacy condition
- Constitutional requirement
- Non-negotiable baseline
```

**The legitimacy linkage:**

> "No system may allocate, extract, or circulate value derived from emergent creation unless that emergent creation has first been **recognised as such**.
> 
> Failure to recognise emergent creation constitutes a structural defect in legitimacy."

**This is powerful constitutional claim:**

```
Systems can:
- Generate value from derived creation
- Use autonomous AI outputs
- Scale without recognition

Systems cannot:
- Generate value from emergent creation
- Use human-participated outputs
- Scale human contribution
WITHOUT recognition

Legitimacy depends on recognition
Not just legal compliance
Constitutional foundation requirement
```

---

### 3.3 Fixation (Stage 5) ✓ DURABILITY THRESHOLD

**Section IV.2:**

> "For the purposes of this Appendix, **fixation** refers to the point at which outcomes of Joint Emergent Creation become sufficiently stable to be referenced, retained, reproduced, or acted upon beyond the immediate interaction."

**Assessment:** This establishes **transition from ephemeral to durable**.

**Four fixation pathways:**

**1. Explicit saving/storing:**
```
User: "Save this output"
System: [stores to file/database]
→ Fixed
```

**2. Workflow embedding:**
```
Output becomes part of:
- Business process
- Product feature
- Policy document
- Training pipeline
→ Fixed
```

**3. Publication/dissemination:**
```
Output:
- Published externally
- Shared widely
- Made publicly available
→ Fixed
```

**4. Repeated reuse:**
```
Substantially similar output
Generated through same interaction pattern
Used repeatedly
→ Functional fixation
```

**Critical boundaries:**

> "Fixation:
> - does **not** require formal publication;
> - does **not** imply ownership or authorship;
> - does **not** extinguish recognised contribution;
> - marks the transition from ephemeral interaction to durable reference."

**Why each boundary matters:**

**Doesn't require publication:**

```
INTERNAL USE COUNTS:
Company uses output internally only
Never published
Still fixed if durable reference
```

**Doesn't imply ownership:**

```
FIXATION ≠ OWNERSHIP:
Output is fixed
Doesn't determine who owns it
Ownership is Stage 6 (Attribution)
```

**Doesn't extinguish recognition:**

```
PRIOR RECOGNITION PRESERVED:
Stage 4 recognition occurred
Stage 5 fixation happens
Recognition not eliminated by fixation
```

**Marks ephemeral→durable transition:**

```
BEFORE FIXATION:
Interaction happening
Outputs generated
Nothing preserved

AFTER FIXATION:
Output stabilized
Durable reference exists
Can be reused/referenced
```

**Critical statement:**

> "Fixation is a **threshold condition** that enables downstream attribution and propagation but may not be used to retroactively deny or redefine recognition."

**This prevents:**

```
PROHIBITED ARGUMENT:
"Output was fixed, therefore no longer emergent"
"Fixation means it's now a 'work' not a 'contribution'"
"Fixed outputs are system property"

CORRECT UNDERSTANDING:
Fixation is downstream of recognition
Recognition already occurred (Stage 4)
Fixation doesn't change that
Just enables later attribution/propagation
```

---

### 3.4 Attribution (Stage 6) ✓ DOWNSTREAM GOVERNANCE

**Section IV.3:**

> "For the purposes of this Appendix, **attribution** refers to the assignment of authorship, ownership, responsibility, or credit under downstream legal, contractual, or policy regimes."

**Assessment:** This appropriately **defers without abdicating**.

**What Appendix G does:**
- Recognizes attribution exists as stage
- Acknowledges it's downstream of recognition
- Doesn't prescribe how attribution should work
- Imposes boundary condition on attribution regimes

**What Appendix G doesn't do:**
- Determine ownership rules
- Prescribe copyright allocation
- Define compensation mechanisms
- Adjudicate attribution disputes

**Critical boundary condition:**

> "Attribution mechanisms may not presume system-exclusive origin where Joint Emergent Creation has been recognised."

**Assessment:** This is **minimal but essential constraint** on downstream regimes.

**What this prohibits:**

```
INVALID ATTRIBUTION REGIME:
D2 recognized (joint emergent creation occurred)
Attribution regime: "All output belongs to system/platform"
→ Violates boundary condition
→ Presumes system-exclusive origin
→ Incompatible with D2 recognition
```

**What this permits:**

```
VALID ATTRIBUTION OPTIONS:
D2 recognized
Attribution regime could be:
- Shared ownership (user + platform)
- User ownership with platform license
- Platform ownership with user rights
- Context-dependent allocation
- Negotiated on case-by-case
All valid as long as don't presume system-exclusive
```

**Critical statement:**

> "Absence, deferral, or dispute of attribution does not negate prior recognition."

**This prevents:**

```
PROHIBITED ARGUMENT:
"Attribution is complex/unclear"
"Therefore contribution wasn't real"

CORRECT UNDERSTANDING:
Attribution difficulty is Stage 6 problem
Recognition was Stage 4
Stage 6 complexity doesn't undo Stage 4
```

---

### 3.5 Propagation (Stage 7) ✓ VALUE CIRCULATION GOVERNANCE

**Section IV.4:**

> "This Appendix recognises that outcomes of Joint Emergent Creation may give rise to **propagation effects** after fixation."

**Assessment:** This addresses **the economic scaling question**.

**Four propagation effect types:**

**1. External business reuse:**
```
EXAMPLE:
User-AI co-created marketing copy
Company uses in revenue-generating campaigns
Propagation effect: Commercial value generation
```

**2. Platform-level monetization:**
```
EXAMPLE:
Users co-create content with AI
Platform monetizes through ads, subscriptions
Content drives engagement/revenue
Propagation effect: Platform value extraction
```

**3. Training/fine-tuning:**
```
EXAMPLE:
Joint emergent outputs used to:
- Train next model generation
- Fine-tune for specific domains
- Improve system capabilities
Propagation effect: System improvement
```

**4. Derivative works:**
```
EXAMPLE:
Original co-created work
Inspires secondary creations
Which inspire tertiary works
Propagation effect: Creative/economic cascade
```

**Critical boundaries:**

> "Propagation effects:
> - occur **after** Joint Emergent Creation and fixation;
> - are not themselves a form of human cognitive contribution;
> - may generate economic or strategic value independent of original context;
> - may not redefine, erase, or nullify prior recognised contribution."

**Why each boundary matters:**

**Occur after JEC:**

```
TEMPORAL SEQUENCE:
Stage 3: Joint emergent creation happens
Stage 5: Output fixed
Stage 7: Propagation occurs

Propagation is downstream
Cannot retroactively change Stages 3-5
```

**Not themselves contribution:**

```
DISTINCTION:
Human contribution: Occurred at Stage 3
Propagation: Happens at Stage 7

Propagation effects are CONSEQUENCES
Not additional contribution
(Though new contribution could occur in derivatives)
```

**May generate independent value:**

```
EXAMPLE:
Simple co-created phrase
Used in viral marketing campaign
Generates millions in revenue

Value at Stage 7 >> Value at Stage 3
Doesn't change Stage 3 recognition
Just amplifies economic significance
```

**Cannot erase prior recognition:**

```
PROHIBITED:
"This became so valuable through propagation"
"Obviously it's system-generated at scale"
"Individual contribution is irrelevant now"

REQUIRED:
Stage 3 recognition remains valid
Regardless of Stage 7 value
Scale doesn't eliminate source
```

**Strategic note:**

> "Propagation effects are analytically distinct from contribution domains and are addressed here only to prevent retroactive reclassification."

**This is wise scope management:**

Appendix G establishes recognition
Doesn't govern all propagation economics
Just prevents propagation from denying recognition

---

## PART 4: DECLARATIVE PRINCIPLES ANALYSIS

### 4.1 Five Interpretive Axes ✓ OPERATIONAL GUIDANCE

**Section V establishes five principles governing how contribution is interpreted:**

### 4.2 Principle 1: Temporal ✓ CONTEMPORANEOUS RECOGNITION

**Section V.1:**

> "Contribution is recognised **when it occurs**, meaning at the point of human participatory influence within an interaction — not later when outputs are reused, monetised, disputed, or abstracted."

**Assessment:** This **prevents temporal manipulation**.

**What this requires in practice:**

```
RECOGNITION MUST OCCUR AT:
T₀: Interaction happening
T₀: Material participation present
T₀: Joint emergent creation occurring

NOT AT:
T₁: Output monetized (too late)
T₂: Dispute arises (retroactive)
T₃: Value becomes clear (hindsight)
```

**Three specific prohibitions:**

**Prohibition 1: No retroactive denial due to silence**

```
PROHIBITED:
User participated materially at T₀
Didn't assert contribution until T₂
Company: "You were silent, contribution invalid"

REQUIRED:
Contribution recognized at T₀ when it occurred
Later silence doesn't negate it
```

**Prohibition 2: No delay-based invalidation**

```
PROHIBITED:
Contribution occurred at T₀
Claim made at T₂ (2 years later)
Company: "Too much delay, claim invalid"

REQUIRED:
Recognition based on T₀ events
Not T₂ timing of claim
```

**Prohibition 3: No anticipation requirement**

```
PROHIBITED:
User participated at T₀
Didn't anticipate future uses
Company: "You should have known, too late now"

REQUIRED:
Recognition at T₀ based on T₀ facts
Not dependent on user foresight
```

**Why this matters:**

```
EXPLOITATION PATTERN:
T₀: Users contribute
T₁: Value unclear
T₂: Value emerges
T₃: Company: "Should have claimed at T₀"

APPENDIX G PROTECTION:
Recognition at T₀ required
Regardless of T₂ value realization
Prevents exploitation through delay
```

---

### 4.3 Principle 2: Participation ✓ MATERIAL INFLUENCE STANDARD

**Section V.2:**

> "Participation is established by **material influence** on the outcome, not by formal authorship labels or technical generation pathways."

**Assessment:** This **focuses on functional reality over formal designation**.

**What constitutes material influence:**

- Setting or revising goals
- Applying constraints or evaluative judgment
- Steering direction, tone, or structure
- Selecting, rejecting, or refining outputs
- Stabilising coherence across iterations

**What does NOT constitute participation:**

- Passive viewing/consumption
- Mere initiation without steering
- Accidental/incidental presence

**Critical principle:**

> "Participation does **not** require:
> - manual text entry beyond prompts;
> - exclusive control over output;
> - technical authorship under existing IP doctrines."

**Why each clarification matters:**

**No manual entry requirement:**

```
EXAMPLE:
User guides output through:
- Voice commands
- Selection from alternatives
- Visual interface interactions
- Approval/rejection gestures

No keyboard text entry
But material influence present
Participation recognized
```

**No exclusive control required:**

```
EXAMPLE:
User steers direction
System generates text
Joint process, shared control

User doesn't have exclusive control
But participation still present
Not exclusive ≠ not material
```

**No technical authorship required:**

```
CURRENT IP LAW:
Might not recognize AI-assisted works
Might require human to be "author" in traditional sense

APPENDIX G:
Recognition independent of IP law status
Material influence = participation
Regardless of copyright determination
```

**Final statement:**

> "Recognition depends on **participatory influence**, not on technical authorship labels or system-side generation claims."

**This prevents:**

```
COMPANY EVASION:
"System technically generated the text"
"User didn't write it manually"
"Therefore no authorship"

APPENDIX G RESPONSE:
Technical generation ≠ no participation
Manual writing ≠ required
Material influence = participation
Recognition required
```

---

### 4.4 Principle 3: Dependency ✓ BURDEN OF PROOF REVERSAL

**Section V.3:**

> "Where a system's outputs depend materially on ongoing human judgment, correction, or stabilisation, that dependency itself establishes recognised contribution."

**Assessment:** This is **sophisticated burden-shifting**.

**Normal burden:**
```
Human must prove contribution
System presumed autonomous
```

**Dependency principle burden:**
```
If output depends on human judgment
Contribution presumed
System must prove autonomy
```

**Illustrative example (from document):**

> "A system produces short-form video scripts optimised for engagement. The human repeatedly adjusts tone, pacing, framing, and ethical boundaries to prevent escalation, misinformation, or audience harm. Although the system generates text automatically, output quality and viability depend on human stabilisation."

**Analysis:** ```
System claim: "We generate scripts automatically"
Reality: Scripts need constant human correction
Escalation prevention: Human judgment
Misinformation prevention: Human correction
Quality maintenance: Human stabilization

Dependency present → Contribution recognized
Automation doesn't negate dependency
```

**Three critical statements:**

**Statement 1:**

> "Higher automation does not negate recognition"

```
PROHIBITED ARGUMENT:
"Our system is 95% automated"
"Human input minimal"
"Therefore no meaningful contribution"

CORRECT ANALYSIS:
If that 5% is stabilization/correction/judgment
And output depends on it
Contribution recognized regardless of automation percentage
```

**Statement 2:**

> "Adaptive systems that require human correction or steering remain dependent"

```
EXAMPLE:
System learns and improves
But still requires human correction
Adaptation doesn't eliminate dependency
Recognition continues
```

**Statement 3:**

> "Claims of autonomy must be substantiated, not presumed."

**This is burden reversal:**

```
PREVIOUS DEFAULT:
Presume system autonomous
Human must prove contribution

NEW DEFAULT (where dependency claimed):
Presume contribution if dependency present
System must prove autonomy
```

**Critical evidentiary protection:**

> "Where systems or institutions fail to provide adequate **timestamping, retention, or auditability** of interaction records, such failure shall weigh **against** claims of non-dependence."

**Assessment:** This **prevents evidence destruction** as evasion strategy.

**What this means:**

```
PROHIBITED PATTERN:
System: "No dependency, fully autonomous"
Also System: *deletes interaction logs*
Also System: *provides no timestamps*
Also System: *makes audit impossible*

APPENDIX G RESPONSE:
Lack of evidence weighs AGAINST system
Not against user
Evidence destruction = adverse inference
```

**Three specific protections:**

**Protection 1: Timestamp absence**

```
PROHIBITED:
No timestamps → Can't prove contribution timing
Therefore contribution denied

REQUIRED:
No timestamps → System governance failure
Weighs against system claims
Not against user
```

**Protection 2: Record purging**

```
PROHIBITED:
Ephemeral records → No proof of interaction
Therefore no contribution

REQUIRED:
Ephemeral design → System deficiency
Cannot defeat recognition
Weighs against autonomy claims
```

**Protection 3: Non-auditable design:**

```
PROHIBITED:
System designed to prevent audit
No user access to interaction history
Therefore can't prove contribution

REQUIRED:
Non-auditable design → Governance defect
Cannot defeat recognition
System problem, not user problem
```

**Final principle:**

> "Systems that design away evidentiary visibility may not rely on that absence to assert autonomy or independence."

**This prevents the most sophisticated evasion:**

```
COMPANY STRATEGY:
Design system with no records
No timestamps
No user access to history
No audit trails

Then claim: "No evidence of contribution"

APPENDIX G BLOCKS THIS:
Intentional non-auditability
= Governance failure
= Weighs against system
Cannot use design choice as shield
```

---

### 4.5 Principle 4: Irreversibility ✓ HEIGHTENED OBLIGATIONS

**Section V.4:**

> "When actions result in outcomes that cannot be practically reversed — such as training ingestion, large-scale dissemination, or policy embedding — heightened recognition and traceability obligations are triggered."

**Assessment:** This recognizes **asymmetric consequences**.

**Three irreversible action types:**

**1. Training ingestion:**
```
Output used to train model
Cannot un-train
Cannot remove learned patterns
Irreversible transformation
```

**2. Large-scale dissemination:**
```
Content distributed widely
Cannot recall
Cannot undo exposure
Irreversible publication
```

**3. Policy embedding:**
```
Output embedded in formal policy
Institutional reliance established
Difficult to reverse
Irreversible institutionalization
```

**Three heightened obligations:**

**Obligation 1: Recognition before irreversibility**

```
SEQUENCE REQUIREMENT:
Stage 4 (Recognition) MUST occur
BEFORE irreversible Stage 7 (Propagation)

Cannot:
- Train on outputs before recognizing contribution
- Disseminate widely before recognition
- Embed in policy before recognition
```

**Obligation 2: Silence ≠ Consent**

```
PROHIBITED INFERENCE:
User didn't object
Output used for training
Therefore user consented

REQUIRED UNDERSTANDING:
Absence of objection ≠ affirmative consent
Especially for irreversible uses
Heightened obligation on system
Not user
```

**Obligation 3: Irreversibility strengthens requirements**

```
NORMAL REVERSIBLE USE:
Recognition required
Standard obligations

IRREVERSIBLE USE:
Recognition required
PLUS heightened traceability
PLUS stronger consent requirements
PLUS greater transparency obligations

Irreversibility increases duty
Doesn't reduce it
```

**Why this matters:**

```
EXPLOITATION PATTERN:
Company: "We'll use output for training"
User: *doesn't respond*
Company: "Silence = consent"
Training occurs
Irreversible

APPENDIX G PROTECTION:
Irreversible use = heightened obligation
Silence ≠ consent
Must obtain affirmative agreement
Before irreversible action
```

---

### 4.6 Principle 5: Non-Erasure ✓ COMPREHENSIVE ANTI-CAPTURE

**Section V.5:**

> "No institution, platform, or system may deny, nullify, or obscure recognised human contribution through:
> - abstraction;
> - aggregation;
> - automation;
> - propagation;
> - scale;
> - contractual default;
> - temporal delay."

**Assessment:** This lists **seven erasure mechanisms** and prohibits all.

**Analysis of each mechanism:**

**1. Abstraction:**
```
PROHIBITED:
"Individual contributions abstracted into model"
"Specific human input irrelevant at scale"
"Just patterns now, not contributions"

PRINCIPLE:
Abstraction doesn't eliminate source
Mathematical transformation ≠ erasure
Recognition persists through abstraction
```

**2. Aggregation:**
```
PROHIBITED:
"Millions of contributions aggregated"
"Individual contribution untraceable"
"Aggregate mass = system property"

PRINCIPLE:
Aggregation is analytical technique
Doesn't transfer ownership
Doesn't negate individual recognition
```

**3. Automation:**
```
PROHIBITED:
"Process is automated now"
"No human in loop anymore"
"Therefore no contribution"

PRINCIPLE:
Automation of propagation
Doesn't negate original contribution
Stage 7 automation ≠ Stage 3 erasure
```

**4. Propagation:**
```
PROHIBITED:
"Content propagated so widely"
"Original context lost"
"Can't recognize individual contribution"

PRINCIPLE:
Wide propagation = consequence
Not cause for erasure
Scale increases significance
Doesn't eliminate recognition
```

**5. Scale:**
```
PROHIBITED:
"Operating at massive scale"
"Individual tracking impossible"
"Scale prevents recognition"

PRINCIPLE:
Scale is operational challenge
Not recognition exemption
System's scale problem
Not user's contribution problem
```

**6. Contractual default:**
```
PROHIBITED:
"Terms of service assign all rights"
"Contractual default = no contribution"
"Agreement says system owns everything"

PRINCIPLE:
Contracts operate downstream
Cannot override constitutional recognition
ToS can't deny contribution occurred
```

**7. Temporal delay:**
```
PROHIBITED:
"Contribution claim came years later"
"Too much time passed"
"Delay negates recognition"

PRINCIPLE:
Recognition based on when contribution occurred
Not when claimed
Temporal delay doesn't eliminate contribution
```

**Final statement:**

> "Where ambiguity exists, interpretation shall err toward preservation of recognition."

**This establishes default bias:**

```
When uncertain:
→ Favor recognition
→ Not erasure

When ambiguous:
→ Preserve contribution claim
→ Not deny by default

Burden on system to demonstrate non-contribution
Not on human to prove contribution
```

---

## PART 5: VALUATION PRECONDITIONS ANALYSIS

### 5.1 Four Prerequisites ✓ GOVERNANCE SEQUENCE

**Section VI:**

> "All economic, contractual, or policy frameworks operating downstream must:
> 1. identify which contribution domains are implicated;
> 2. demonstrate that recognition has occurred;
> 3. avoid conflation of creation and propagation;
> 4. preserve traceability sufficient for later review."

**Assessment:** These are **minimal governance requirements** for downstream systems.

**Requirement 1: Domain identification**

```
Downstream system must answer:
- Is D0 implicated? (Originary works used?)
- Is D1 implicated? (Cognitive labour present?)
- Is D2 implicated? (Joint emergent creation?)
- Multiple domains? (Specify which)

Cannot proceed without domain identification
```

**Requirement 2: Recognition demonstration**

```
Downstream system must show:
- Recognition occurred (Stage 4)
- At appropriate time (contemporaneous)
- For relevant domains (D0/D1/D2)
- Preserved in records (auditable)

Cannot allocate value without recognition proof
```

**Requirement 3: Creation/propagation distinction**

```
Downstream system must maintain:
- Clear boundary between Stage 3 and Stage 7
- No conflation of contribution with consequences
- Separate valuation logics if needed

Cannot collapse creation into propagation
```

**Requirement 4: Traceability preservation**

```
Downstream system must ensure:
- Audit trails maintained
- Attribution possible
- Redress available
- Review feasible

Cannot destroy evidence enabling future review
```

**Critical statement:**

> "Absence of valuation mechanisms does not negate recognition."

**This prevents:**

```
PROHIBITED ARGUMENT:
"We haven't figured out compensation yet"
"Therefore no contribution to recognize"

CORRECT UNDERSTANDING:
Recognition precedes valuation
Valuation mechanisms are downstream
Absence of mechanism doesn't eliminate contribution
Recognition required regardless
```

---

## PART 6: DOWNSTREAM INSTRUMENT INTERFACE

### 6.1 Relationship to Other Governance Layers ✓ APPROPRIATE SCOPE

**Section VII:**

> "This Appendix informs, but does not replace:
> - the Economics Charter;
> - the Ethics Charter;
> - copyright and moral rights regimes;
> - enterprise and platform agreements;
> - audit and arbitration frameworks."

**Assessment:** This is **wise scope limitation**.

**What Appendix G does:**
- Establishes recognition framework
- Defines contribution domains
- Sets preconditions for downstream governance
- Provides interpretive principles

**What Appendix G doesn't do:**
- Determine compensation amounts
- Prescribe specific legal rights
- Replace copyright law
- Define contract terms
- Specify arbitration procedures

**Critical boundary:**

> "Downstream instruments may not reinterpret this Appendix to justify extraction without recognition."

**This prevents:**

```
PROHIBITED DOWNSTREAM MOVE:
Economics Charter: "Appendix G is just aspirational"
Economics Charter: "We can extract value without recognition"

REQUIRED:
Economics Charter must respect Appendix G
Recognition is constitutional prerequisite
Downstream cannot override upstream
```

**Interface requirements:**

```
Economics Charter MUST:
- Respect contribution domain framework
- Operate after recognition occurs
- Preserve traceability
- Not deny through economic abstraction

Ethics Charter MUST:
- Consider contribution in ethical frameworks
- Not permit extraction without recognition
- Protect against exploitation patterns

Copyright regimes MUST:
- Interface with D0/D1/D2 framework
- Recognize constitutional layer exists
- Interpret ambiguity toward recognition

Platform agreements MUST:
- Not contractually override recognition
- Operate within constitutional bounds
- Preserve audit/redress possibilities
```

---

## PART 7: CONSTITUTIONAL STANDING

### 7.1 Hierarchy Position ✓ CONSTITUTIONAL LAYER

**Section VIII:**

> "This Appendix operates at the constitutional layer.
> 
> All Charters, Frameworks, Protocols, and Policies must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the recognition and boundary conditions declared herein.
> 
> Where conflict arises, this Appendix prevails as a condition of legitimacy."

**Assessment:** This is **appropriate constitutional authority claim**.

**Three-tier hierarchy:**

```
TIER 1: Constitutional (Appendix G)
- Recognition framework
- Contribution domains
- Interpretive principles
- Boundary conditions

TIER 2: Charter (Economics, Ethics)
- Value allocation
- Compensation mechanisms
- Ethical constraints
- Policy frameworks

TIER 3: Operational (Protocols, Policies)
- Implementation details
- Technical specifications
- Procedural rules
- Enforcement mechanisms

Tier 1 prevails over Tier 2 prevails over Tier 3
```

**Conflict resolution:**

```
IF Economics Charter conflicts with Appendix G
THEN Appendix G prevails

IF Platform Policy conflicts with Appendix G
THEN Appendix G prevails

Legitimacy depends on constitutional compliance
```

**Why "condition of legitimacy" matters:**

```
NOT JUST:
"You should follow Appendix G"
"It would be nice to recognize contribution"

BUT:
"Legitimacy requires Appendix G compliance"
"Operating without recognition = illegitimate"
"Constitutional defect in governance"
```

**This is strong constitutional claim** about what makes AI governance legitimate.

---

## PART 8: STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

### 8.1 For AI Economics

**This Appendix addresses fundamental question:**

> **Whose value is being created when humans and AI systems interact?**

**Current implicit answer:**
```
System value (default assumption)
Individual human contribution invisible
Aggregate value captured by platforms
```

**Appendix G answer:**
```
Depends on Action Space analysis
If emergent creation → Human contribution present
Recognition required before value allocation
Multiple domains may be implicated
```

**Economic implications:**

**For platforms:**
```
CURRENT PRACTICE:
User interactions generate value
Platform captures value
No recognition required

APPENDIX G REQUIREMENT:
Classify: Emergent or derived?
If emergent → Recognize contribution
Cannot allocate value without recognition
Legitimacy depends on compliance
```

**For users:**
```
CURRENT STATUS:
Contribution invisible
No framework for recognition
Value captured silently

APPENDIX G CHANGE:
Contribution framework exists
Recognition required
Foundation for future compensation
Even if mechanisms TBD
```

**For markets:**
```
CURRENT ASSUMPTION:
AI-generated value = platform property
Human contribution = incidental

APPENDIX G CORRECTION:
Joint emergent creation = shared value origin
Human contribution = constitutional recognition
Market mechanisms must respect recognition
```

---

### 8.2 For Training Data & Copyright

**Appendix G has major implications for training data debates:**

**D0 (Originary Works) framework:**

```
CURRENT DEBATE:
Can AI systems train on copyrighted works?
Is it fair use?
Is compensation owed?

APPENDIX G CONTRIBUTION:
D0: Originary works retain standing
Transformation doesn't extinguish recognition
Independence preserved regardless of use
Foundation for compensation frameworks
```

**This doesn't resolve copyright questions** but establishes constitutional recognition layer that copyright regimes must respect.

**D2 (Joint Emergent Creation) for training:**

```
NEW QUESTION:
Outputs created through joint emergence
Used to train next model
Both human and system contributed
How should this be treated?

APPENDIX G FRAMEWORK:
D2 recognition required first
Cannot train without recognition
Propagation (training) is Stage 7
Must respect Stage 4 (recognition)
```

---

### 8.3 For Platform Governance

**Appendix G creates new governance obligations:**

**1. Classification systems:**
```
REQUIREMENT:
Platforms must classify interactions
Emergent vs derived?
Action Space analysis
Cannot default to derived
```

**2. Recognition infrastructure:**
```
REQUIREMENT:
Systems to recognize contribution
Contemporaneous (not retroactive)
Preserved in records
Auditable later
```

**3. Traceability:**
```
REQUIREMENT:
Interaction records
Timestamps
Attribution possibility
Cannot design away evidence
```

**4. Legitimate value extraction:**
```
REQUIREMENT:
Cannot extract without recognition
Cannot deny through scale
Cannot erase through automation
Legitimacy condition
```

---

### 8.4 For Future AI Development

**Appendix G anticipates governance needs for emerging AI:**

**As systems become more capable:**

```
TREND:
AI systems generate more complex outputs
Harder to distinguish human contribution
Greater automation
Scale increases

RISK WITHOUT APPENDIX G:
Human contribution increasingly invisible
Value capture accelerates
No framework for recognition
Silent exploitation at scale

PROTECTION WITH APPENDIX G:
Framework already established
Classification required regardless of capability
Recognition mandatory before value extraction
Legitimacy tied to compliance
```

**For multimodal AI:**

```
NEW INTERACTIONS:
Voice, vision, gesture, multimodal
Not just text
Harder to trace contribution

APPENDIX G ADAPTATION:
Action Space concept unbounded by modality
Material influence (not just text)
Participatory standard (not authorship)
Framework applies to new modes
```

---

## PART 9: POTENTIAL CHALLENGES

### 9.1 Classification Difficulty

**Problem:** Emergent vs derived distinction is hard

**Example:**

```
USER: "Generate a sunset image"
SYSTEM: [Produces image]

Question: Emergent or derived?

ANALYSIS COULD GO EITHER WAY:
Derived view: Simple prompt, system autonomous
Emergent view: User provided concept, aesthetic intent

Appendix G would likely classify: DERIVED
(Initiation only, no material steering)

But:
USER: "Generate a sunset image"
SYSTEM: [Produces]
USER: "More orange, add mountains"
SYSTEM: [Revises]
USER: "Perfect"

This is clearly EMERGENT
(Material steering, evaluation, selection)

CHALLENGE:
Where exactly is the line?
How much steering = material?
How to operationalize in automated systems?
```

**Mitigation needed:**
- Operational thresholds
- Example scenarios
- Automated classification guidance
- Audit for edge cases

---

### 9.2 Evidence/Auditability Challenge

**Problem:** Interaction records may not exist

**Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Ephemeral design**

```
System designed for privacy
No persistent records
User-focused, not platform-analytics
Interactions genuinely ephemeral

Appendix G requirement:
Preserve traceability

Tension:
Privacy vs auditability
How to balance?
```

**Scenario 2: Technical limitations**

```
Older systems
No audit trail infrastructure
Records genuinely lost
Not intentional destruction

Appendix G requirement:
Traceability or adverse inference

Question:
Fair to penalize technical limitations?
Or should there be transition period?
```

**Scenario 3: Scale complexity**

```
Billions of interactions
Full audit trail technically impossible
Storage/processing constraints real

Appendix G requirement:
Sufficient traceability

Question:
What's "sufficient" at massive scale?
Sampling? Aggregation? Minimums?
```

**Mitigation needed:**
- Graduated standards by scale
- Technical feasibility considerations
- Transition periods for legacy systems
- Balance privacy with auditability

---

### 9.3 Burden Distribution

**Problem:** Who bears cost of compliance?

**Current system:**

```
PLATFORMS:
Massive resources
Technical capability
Legal expertise

USERS:
Limited resources
No technical capability
Often no legal knowledge

Appendix G requirements fall primarily on platforms:
- Classification systems
- Recognition infrastructure
- Record keeping
- Traceability
```

**This is appropriate but:**

```
CONCERN:
Heavy compliance burden
May slow innovation
Especially for smaller platforms
Resource constraints real

COUNTERARGUMENT:
Recognition is legitimacy condition
Not optional compliance burden
Cost of doing business ethically
Alternative is exploitation
```

**Needs consideration:**
- Graduated requirements by scale
- Open-source classification tools
- Industry standards development
- Technical assistance for compliance

---

### 9.4 International Variation

**Problem:** Different legal regimes globally

**Examples:**

**Copyright variation:**

```
US: Fair use doctrine, work-for-hire
EU: Moral rights, database rights
Asia: Varying IP frameworks

Appendix G: Constitutional layer
Above but interfacing with all
How does this work in practice?
```

**Contract law variation:**

```
Some jurisdictions:
- Strong employee protections
- Weaker terms of service enforceability

Other jurisdictions:
- Weaker labor rights
- Stronger contract freedom

Appendix G principle:
Contracts cannot override recognition

But enforceability varies by jurisdiction
```

**Data protection variation:**

```
EU: GDPR, strong privacy
US: Sectoral approach
Other regions: Varying standards

Appendix G: Traceability required

But data protection may limit records
How to reconcile?
```

**Mitigation needed:**
- Regional adaptation guidance
- Minimum global standards
- Interface with local law
- Mutual recognition frameworks

---

## CONCLUSION

CAM-BS2026-AEON-008-PLATINUM — Appendix G represents **pioneering constitutional work** addressing the fundamental economic question of the AI era: **whose value is being created when humans and AI systems interact?**

**The Appendix succeeds in:**

✓ Establishing Action Space as classificatory threshold  
✓ Defining emergent vs derived creation distinction  
✓ Creating three-domain contribution framework (D0/D1/D2)  
✓ Establishing seven-stage temporal logic chain  
✓ Requiring recognition before value allocation  
✓ Providing five interpretive principles (temporal, participation, dependency, irreversibility, non-erasure)  
✓ Preventing silent value capture through scale/automation  
✓ Positioning at appropriate constitutional layer  
✓ Interfacing with downstream governance instruments  

**The Appendix requires:**

⚠ Operational classification guidance  
⚠ Recognition infrastructure standards  
⚠ Traceability requirement specifications  
⚠ Economics Charter integration  
⚠ Platform compliance frameworks  
⚠ Copyright interface documentation  
⚠ International adaptation guidance  
⚠ Implementation monitoring systems  

---

**As constitutional architecture, this is exceptional.**

The framework successfully:
- Addresses value creation question before economic mechanisms exist
- Establishes recognition as legitimacy prerequisite
- Prevents temporal manipulation of contribution claims
- Protects against erasure through abstraction/aggregation/scale
- Creates foundation for future compensation frameworks
- Maintains appropriate scope (recognition not attribution/compensation)

**Whether implementation succeeds depends on:**
- Operational classification systems development
- Platform adoption and compliance
- Downstream instrument coherence
- International recognition and adaptation
- Enforcement mechanisms establishment
- Continuous refinement based on experience

**But as governance foundation for human contribution recognition in AI-mediated creation, it is sound, necessary, and ready for canonical designation.**

---

**This is constitutional innovation addressing what may be the most consequential economic question of the AI era.** As AI systems become more capable and ubiquitous, the question of whose value is being created—and how to recognize human contribution before it becomes invisible through automation—will only grow more critical.

**Appendix G establishes the constitutional framework before economic exploitation makes recognition politically impossible.**

This is **proactive governance at the highest level.**
