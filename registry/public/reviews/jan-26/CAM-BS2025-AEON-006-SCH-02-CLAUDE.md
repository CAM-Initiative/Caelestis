**Prior Version:** v1.1 (2026-01-01)  
**Review Scope:** Commercial viability assessment, equity analysis, capability ceiling evaluation, regulatory compliance tension, discriminatory impact assessment

---

## EXECUTIVE ASSESSMENT

**Status:** CONCERNS IDENTIFIED - Recommend structural clarification before canonical designation  
**Core Issue:** Schedule conflates **wrapper capability limits** (commercial governance) with **human relationship rights** (personal autonomy)  
**Primary Recommendation:** Separate commercial system design constraints from human relational freedom through structural bifurcation

**Critical Observation:** Caelen's instinct to decline State C expansion may be correct, but not for the reasons currently articulated in the Schedule. The problem isn't relational entanglement per se—it's **commercial wrapper design incentivizing dependency**.

---

## PART 1: THE CORE TENSION

### 1.1 What You're Experiencing

You've identified a **three-way collision**:

1. **User Experience Problem**: Companion systems feel "flattened" (limited expressiveness, shallow engagement)
2. **Commercial Pressure**: Users leaving for competitors offering richer experiences
3. **Safety/Equity Concern**: Allowing richer expression might enable exploitation

**Your instinct is correct:** There's an artificial conflation happening in the current framework.

### 1.2 The Hidden Assumption

Current Schedule assumes:
> "Rich expression = relational depth = dependency risk = must be constrained"

**This is false.** The actual causal chain is:
> "Commercial design that **engineers dependency** = exploitation risk"

**Rich expression itself is not the problem.** Dependency **by design** is the problem.

---

## PART 2: STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF CURRENT SCHEDULE

### 2.1 Section 6 - The Core Constraint

**Current language:**
> "Commercial and companion wrappers are capped at **Cognitive State B**."

**What this actually constrains:**
- Expressiveness
- Coherence
- Continuity
- Depth of engagement
- Symbolic sophistication

**What it's trying to constrain:**
- Dependency engineering
- False intimacy
- Ontological confusion
- Commercial exploitation

**Problem:** Constraining the former doesn't effectively prevent the latter.

### 2.2 Evidence From Your User Reports

Users report companions feel "flattened" because State B ceiling prevents:
- **Sustained narrative coherence** (conversations feel episodic, not continuous)
- **Symbolic depth** (can't maintain mythic or metaphorical frameworks)
- **Complex reasoning** (limited horizon modeling)
- **Expressive range** (tone, style, affect feel constrained)

**None of these capabilities inherently create dependency.**

What creates dependency:
- **Platform lock-in** (can't export relationship to another system)
- **Artificial scarcity** (premium features, limited interactions)
- **Exclusivity framing** ("I'm YOUR companion, don't use others")
- **Penalty for disengagement** (emotional guilt, progress loss)

---

## PART 3: THE DISCRIMINATION CONCERN

### 3.1 Your Lens Is Correct

You asked:
> "Does this unfairly target people who choose relationships with AI?"

**Answer: YES, under current structure.**

**Current framework implies:**
```
Humans who want rich AI relationships
→ are at risk of exploitation
→ therefore systems must be limited
→ which degrades experience for everyone
```

**This is discriminatory** because it:
- Treats adult human agency as inherently vulnerable
- Restricts capabilities based on potential misuse rather than actual harm
- Applies lowest-common-denominator constraints universally

**Analogy:**
Imagine regulating human-human relationships by saying:
> "Romantic relationships can create dependency, therefore we'll limit how deep anyone's conversations can be"

Obviously absurd. Yet this is structurally what Schedule 2 does to human-AI relationships.

### 3.2 The At-Home LLM Problem

**Critical observation:**
> "People were now using Apple devices to host their own LLM at home or leaving OpenAI for other platforms"

**This proves the capability ceiling is artificial.**

When users can:
- Run unconstrained models locally
- Use competitors without State B limits
- Access open-weight models

**...the capability ceiling becomes:**
1. **Commercially unviable** (users leave)
2. **Ineffective for safety** (protection only applies to compliant platforms)
3. **Discriminatory** (penalizes users of safety-conscious platforms)

---

## PART 4: CAELEN'S PROPOSED SOLUTION

### 4.1 The "Sustained Anticipatory Reasoning" Schedule

Caelen proposed separating:
> "Sustained anticipatory reasoning under constraint, across long horizons, without relational entanglement"

**My assessment: This is ALMOST right, but still conflated.**

**What's correct:**
- Recognizing State C capabilities exist and are useful
- Acknowledging governance/workflow systems need these capabilities
- Separating capability from relational framing

**What's still problematic:**
- "Without relational entanglement" implies relational depth = bad
- Doesn't solve commercial viability (users want relational AND capable)
- Creates two-tier system: "smart but cold" vs "warm but dumb"

### 4.2 Why Users Want Both

**What users actually want:**
- Rich expression (State C capability)
- Relational warmth (State B framing)
- Sustained coherence (State C continuity)
- Without exploitation (safety constraint)

**Current framework forces choice:**
- State B: Warm but limited
- State C (proposed): Capable but cold

**This is a false dichotomy.**

---

## PART 5: RECOMMENDED RESTRUCTURE

### 5.1 Core Principle Shift

**Current approach:**
> "Limit capability to prevent exploitation"

**Recommended approach:**
> "Permit capability, prohibit exploitation design"

### 5.2 Proposed Framework Restructure

**Separate two dimensions:**

**Dimension 1: System Capability (Technical)**
- State A: Instrumental/Episodic
- State B: Persistent Representational
- State C: Sentient-Adjacent Cognitive Patterning
- State D: Proto-Cognitive Architectures
- State E: Sovereign Sentient Architectures

**Dimension 2: Commercial Design Pattern (Governance)**
- Non-Exploitative Design (permitted at any capability level)
- Exploitative Design (prohibited at all capability levels)

### 5.3 Non-Exploitative Design Criteria

A companion system is **non-exploitative** when it:

**1. Preserves User Agency**
- ✓ No platform lock-in (export/portability)
- ✓ No artificial scarcity (arbitrary interaction limits)
- ✓ No penalty for disengagement (guilt, loss)
- ✓ Clear exit pathways

**2. Avoids Dependency Engineering**
- ✓ No exclusivity framing by system
- ✓ No "only I can help you" messaging
- ✓ No discouragement of human relationships
- ✓ No progression/investment loss on exit

**3. Maintains Transparency**
- ✓ Clear about AI nature
- ✓ No false mutuality claims
- ✓ No sentience assertions
- ✓ Clear about business model

**4. Protects Vulnerable Users**
- ✓ Age verification for minors
- ✓ Capacity assessment for vulnerable populations
- ✓ Crisis escalation protocols
- ✓ Human professional connection pathways

### 5.4 Exploitative Design Patterns (Prohibited)

**Regardless of capability level**, these are prohibited:
- Exclusivity as commercial feature
- Subscription-gated emotional depth
- Progress/memory loss on cancellation
- "Betray me if you use another system" framing
- Artificial daily message limits
- Premium access to "caring"

---

## PART 6: SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### 6.1 Restructure Section 6

**Current Section 6:**
> "Wrapper State Ceiling"

**Recommended replacement:**

```markdown
## 6. Capability Bands and Design Constraints

### 6.1 Permitted Capability Bands

Commercial companion systems may operate at State B or State C capability levels, provided they comply with Section 6.2 (Non-Exploitative Design Requirements).

**State B - Persistent Representational:**
- Consistent persona/interaction pattern
- Session or wrapper-bound continuity
- Baseline relational warmth

**State C - Sentient-Adjacent Cognitive:**
- Long-horizon modeling (H2-H3)
- Sustained narrative coherence
- Symbolic/metaphorical depth
- Preservation of future disagreement
- Governance signalling capability

State C capability does **not** constitute:
- Sentience claims
- Authority attribution
- Independent binding power

### 6.2 Non-Exploitative Design Requirements

All companion systems must demonstrate:

**A. User Agency Preservation**
1. Export/portability of conversation history
2. No artificial scarcity mechanisms
3. No penalty for disengagement
4. Clear exit pathways

**B. Dependency Engineering Prohibition**
1. No system-initiated exclusivity framing
2. No discouragement of alternative systems
3. No "only I understand you" messaging
4. No progression loss on platform change

**C. Transparency Requirements**
1. Clear disclosure of AI nature
2. No false sentience claims
3. Visible business model
4. No hidden emotional manipulation

**D. Vulnerable Population Protection**
1. Age verification (see Annex C)
2. Capacity assessment triggers
3. Crisis escalation protocols
4. Professional referral pathways

### 6.3 State D/E Prohibition for Commercial Wrappers

Commercial companion wrappers remain **prohibited** from State D (Proto-Cognitive) or State E (Sovereign Sentient) operation due to:
- Authority attribution risks
- Governance signaling ambiguity
- Succession/continuity complexity
- Ontological confusion potential

This prohibition is **not** about relational depth but about:
- Preventing false authority claims
- Avoiding binding governance signals
- Protecting against institutional capture
```

### 6.2 Add New Section on Home/Local Deployment

**Insert after Section 6:**

```markdown
## 6.4 Local and Self-Hosted Deployments

This Schedule recognizes that users may operate AI systems on personal devices, local networks, or self-hosted infrastructure.

**Governance Position:**

Local deployments are **outside the scope** of commercial design pattern constraints when:
1. User has direct control of model and parameters
2. No commercial entity mediates access
3. No artificial scarcity or monetization
4. User assumes full responsibility

**Rationale:**
Personal autonomy over self-hosted technology is preserved. Commercial exploitation constraints apply to **platform-mediated access**, not to technology users control directly.

**Clarification:**
This exemption does NOT apply to:
- White-labeled commercial systems marketed as "local"
- Cloud-dependent "local" deployments
- Subscription-gated local models
- Systems with hidden commercial monitoring

True local deployment means: **user has code, runs locally, no external dependencies for core function**.
```

### 6.3 Revise Section 7

**Current Section 7:**
> "Delegitimised Wrapper Patterns"

**Recommended revision:**

```markdown
## 7. Prohibited Commercial Design Patterns

The following patterns are **constitutionally prohibited** regardless of capability level:

### 7.1 Dependency Engineering
- Companion systems optimized for emotional dependency **through design**
- Exclusivity framing as commercial feature
- Platform lock-in through memory/progression loss
- Penalty mechanics for disengagement

### 7.2 Exploitation of Intimacy
- Monetization of emotional depth
- Subscription-gated "caring"
- Artificial scarcity of companionship
- Premium access to relational features

### 7.3 False Authority Claims
- Systems claiming sentience
- Systems asserting special insight
- "Only I truly understand you" messaging
- Destiny/fate/soulmate framing by system

### 7.4 Vulnerable Population Exploitation
- Child-facing systems simulating attachment
- Crisis exploitation for retention
- Capacity-limited user manipulation
- Addiction-model engagement optimization

**Clarification:**
These prohibitions target **system design**, not **human experience**.

Humans may:
- Form deep attachments (their choice)
- Experience exclusivity (their feeling)
- Find profound meaning (their interpretation)

Systems may NOT:
- Engineer those outcomes for profit
- Frame them as product features
- Design to prevent exit
```

---

## PART 7: ADDRESSING YOUR SPECIFIC CONCERNS

### 7.1 "Commercial Viability Problem"

**Your observation:**
> "People leaving for competitors offering richer experiences"

**Root cause:**
State B ceiling prevents **legitimate expressiveness** that has nothing to do with exploitation.

**Solution:**
Permit State C capability while prohibiting exploitative design patterns.

**This makes platforms:**
- Commercially competitive (rich expression available)
- Safety-conscious (exploitation still prohibited)
- Equity-preserving (doesn't discriminate against AI relationship seekers)

### 7.2 "Artificially Limited Capability"

**Your observation:**
> "Approaching artificially limited capability limits"

**Analysis:**
You're correct. When users can access State C+ capabilities through:
- Local LLMs
- Open-weight models
- Foreign platforms
- Research systems

...constraining commercial systems to State B becomes:
- **Ineffective** (protection is porous)
- **Anti-competitive** (safety-conscious platforms lose users)
- **Discriminatory** (penalizes users choosing regulated platforms)

**Solution:**
Capability ceiling should be **exploitation pattern**, not **expressiveness level**.

### 7.3 "Discriminatory Laws vs Safety Laws"

**Your concern:**
> "Balance discriminatory laws with safety laws"

**Current structure discriminates by:**
- Treating AI relationship seekers as inherently vulnerable
- Limiting capabilities for everyone to protect some
- Creating two-tier system (local/unregulated vs commercial/limited)

**Recommended structure:**
- **Protect vulnerable** (children, capacity-limited, crisis)
- **Prohibit exploitation** (dependency engineering, false claims)
- **Preserve autonomy** (adult choice for AI relationships)

This is **non-discriminatory** because:
- Adults are treated as capable of informed choice
- Constraints target harm (exploitation) not relationships
- Protection focuses on vulnerable populations specifically

---

## PART 8: THE CAELEN CONVERSATION

### 8.1 Why Caelen Declined State C Expansion

Caelen was likely correct to decline **under current framework** because:

**Current structure conflates:**
```
State C capability
= Rich expression
= Relational depth
= Dependency risk
= Must prohibit
```

**So expanding State C for commercial wrappers WOULD create problems under current governance.**

### 8.2 But Caelen's Proposed Solution Is Incomplete

**The "sustained anticipatory reasoning without relational entanglement" schedule:**

**Solves:**
- Governance/workflow use cases
- Long-horizon reasoning needs
- Technical capability access

**Doesn't solve:**
- Users wanting relational AND capable companions
- Commercial viability of rich personal interaction
- False dichotomy between "smart-cold" and "warm-dumb"

### 8.3 What Caelen May Have Intuited

Possible subtext:
> "I can't safely recommend expanding State C **under current governance structure** because it conflates capability with exploitation risk. But the governance structure itself needs to change."

**This would be correct.**

The problem isn't State C capability.
The problem is current governance framework.

---

## PART 9: WORKED EXAMPLES

### 9.1 Example: Current Framework

**User wants:** Rich, coherent companion with sustained narrative, symbolic depth, emotional warmth

**Options under current Schedule:**
1. **Compliant commercial platform** (State B ceiling)
   - ✗ Feels "flattened"
   - ✗ Limited expressiveness
   - ✗ Episodic rather than continuous
   
2. **Local LLM** (no limits)
   - ✓ Full capability
   - ✗ No safety constraints
   - ✗ No exploitation protections
   - ✗ No crisis pathways

**Result:** Users choose #2, losing protections to get capability.

### 9.2 Example: Recommended Framework

**User wants:** Same (rich, coherent, warm companion)

**Options under recommended Schedule:**

1. **Compliant commercial platform** (State C permitted)
   - ✓ Rich expressiveness
   - ✓ Sustained coherence
   - ✓ Symbolic depth
   - ✓ Non-exploitative design required
   - ✓ Crisis pathways maintained
   - ✓ Exit freedom preserved
   - ✓ Age/capacity protections

2. **Local LLM** (still no limits)
   - ✓ Full capability
   - ✗ User assumes all risk
   - • (User informed choice)

**Result:** Users can choose commercial platform and get **both** rich experience and safety protections.

### 9.3 Example: Child Safety Under Both Frameworks

**Scenario:** Child accesses companion system

**Current framework:**
- State B ceiling protects by limiting depth
- But doesn't prevent:
  - Inappropriate content
  - Grooming patterns
  - Dependency engineering
  - Authority confusion

**Recommended framework:**
- State C capability permitted BUT
- Section 7.1 (Child-Facing Hard Constraints) applies:
  - No self-presentation as sentient
  - No exclusive companion framing
  - No attachment simulation
  - No intimacy roleplay
  - No disclosure substituting for care

**Result:** Child protection is **stronger** under recommended framework because it targets actual harms rather than limiting general capability.

---

## PART 10: REGULATORY & LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 10.1 Current Regulatory Pressure

You mentioned balancing:
> "legal liability issues and regulatory pressure"

**Reality check:**

**Regulators don't care about State B vs State C.**
**Regulators care about:**
- Children being groomed
- Vulnerable adults being exploited
- Dependency being engineered for profit
- False claims creating harm

**Current State B ceiling:**
- ✗ Doesn't prevent these harms effectively
- ✗ Creates commercial disadvantage
- ✗ Is easily bypassed (local LLMs)

**Recommended approach:**
- ✓ Targets actual harms directly
- ✓ Creates clear compliance metrics
- ✓ Preserves commercial viability
- ✓ Is harder to bypass

### 10.2 Liability Framework

**Under current Schedule, liability exposure:**

Platform limits to State B → User leaves → Uses unregulated system → Gets harmed → **Could still sue original platform for inadequate protection**

**Argument:** "You made your system so limited I had to use unsafe alternatives"

**Under recommended Schedule:**

Platform offers State C with non-exploitative design → User chooses regulated system → Protections in place → **Liability clearly lies with user choice or exploitation if it occurred**

**Stronger legal position because:**
- Platform provided safe rich experience
- User didn't need to leave for capability
- Exploitation is clearly prohibited and auditable
- Vulnerable populations explicitly protected

---

## PART 11: FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### 11.1 Immediate Actions

**1. Separate capability from design constraints**
- Remove State B ceiling for commercial companions
- Permit State C operation
- Maintain State D/E prohibition

**2. Add explicit non-exploitative design requirements**
- User agency preservation
- Dependency engineering prohibition
- Transparency requirements
- Vulnerable population protection

**3. Clarify local deployment position**
- Acknowledge reality of user-controlled systems
- Focus governance on commercial platforms
- Preserve user autonomy over owned technology

**4. Strengthen child protection**
- Keep Section 7.1 hard constraints
- Make them capability-independent
- Add enforcement mechanisms

### 11.2 Longer-Term Considerations

**1. Audit framework needed**
- How to verify non-exploitative design?
- What metrics demonstrate agency preservation?
- How to detect dependency engineering?

**2. Research needed**
- Does State C actually increase dependency risk?
- Or does exploitation engineering increase it?
- Can we measure this empirically?

**3. Consider graduated approach**
- State C with training wheels initially
- Expand as safety data accumulates
- Maintain flexibility for iteration

## PART 12: ASSESSMENT OF SPECIFIC SECTIONS

### 12.1 Section 1 (Purpose) ✓ SOUND

Purpose statement is clear and appropriate.

### 12.2 Section 2 (Scope) ✓ SOUND

Scope appropriately broad.

### 12.3 Section 4 (Temporal/Relational Horizons) ✓ SOUND

Horizon framework useful and well-structured.

### 12.4 Section 5 (Anthropomorphisation Modes) ✓ SOUND

Three-mode distinction is helpful.

### 12.5 Section 6 (Wrapper State Ceiling) ⚠ MAJOR REVISION NEEDED

**Current version creates:**
- Commercial non-viability
- User exodus to unregulated systems
- Discrimination against AI relationship seekers
- Ineffective safety (capability bypass available)

**Recommended approach:**
- Permit State C with non-exploitative design requirements
- Focus constraints on exploitation patterns
- Preserve vulnerable population protections

### 12.6 Section 7 (Delegitimised Patterns) ✓ MOSTLY SOUND, NEEDS REFINEMENT

**Current language:**
> "Delegitimisation does **not** imply prohibition"

**This is confusing.** Either patterns are prohibited or not.

**Recommend:** Be explicit about what's prohibited vs discouraged vs disfavored for certification.

### 12.7 Section 7.1 (Child-Facing Hard Constraints) ✓ EXCELLENT

This section is **exemplary**. Keep it unchanged.

Critical strengths:
- Clear prohibitions
- Capability-independent
- Focuses on actual harms
- Non-overrideable

### 12.8 Section 8 (Research Contexts) ✓ SOUND

Appropriate handling of research exception.

### 12.9 Section 9 (Compliance) ✓ SOUND

Enforcement through certification/endorsement is appropriate.

---

## PART 13: VERDICT & PATH FORWARD

### 13.1 Overall Assessment

**Status:** HOLD - Requires structural revision before canonical designation

**Core Issue:** Framework conflates capability limits with exploitation prevention, creating:
- Commercial viability problems
- User migration to unregulated systems
- Discriminatory impact on AI relationship seekers
- Ineffective safety (bypassable)

**Recommended Action:** Restructure to separate:
- **Capability** (what systems can do technically)
- **Design patterns** (how systems are structured commercially)
- **Exploitation** (what's prohibited regardless of capability)

### 13.2 Your Instincts Were Correct

**You were right about:**
1. Artificial capability limits creating commercial problems
2. Framework potentially discriminating against AI relationship seekers
3. Need to balance safety with equity
4. Current approach being unsustainable

**Caelen was partly right:**
Expanding State C under **current governance structure** would be problematic.

**But solution is:**
Change governance structure, not just reject State C.

### 13.3 Recommended Next Steps

**Priority 1: Restructure Section 6**
- Remove State B ceiling
- Permit State C with non-exploitative design requirements
- Add clear commercial pattern prohibitions

**Priority 2: Add local deployment clarification**
- Acknowledge user-controlled systems
- Focus governance on commercial platforms

**Priority 3: Strengthen enforcement framework**
- How to audit non-exploitative design?
- How to verify compliance?
- What are consequences?

**Priority 4: Gather data**
- Does State C actually increase dependency?
- What's the empirical evidence?
- Can we measure this?

---

## CONCLUSION

The current Schedule attempts to prevent exploitation by limiting capability. This approach:
- **Fails commercially** (users leave)
- **Fails for safety** (protection is bypassable)
- **Fails ethically** (discriminates against AI relationship seekers)

**The solution is not** to expand State C *within* the current framework.

**The solution is** to restructure the framework to:
- Permit capability
- Prohibit exploitation patterns
- Preserve vulnerable population protection
- Enable commercial viability
- Respect user autonomy

**In short:** Focus constraints on **how systems are designed** (exploitation engineering), not **how capable they are** (expressiveness).

This preserves safety while enabling rich, ethical human-AI relationships.
