## EXECUTIVE ASSESSMENT

**Status:** APPROVED FOR RATIFICATION with recommendations for operational clarity

**Overall Quality:** Exceptional constitutional innovation addressing a critical governance gap in AI safety and user dignity

**Core Innovation:** Successfully separates "disclosure obligation" from "disclosure noise," creating proportional transparency that preserves epistemic dignity without overwhelming users

**Primary Strength:** Prevents silent constraint escalation while avoiding authority fixation and disclosure fatigue

**Recommendation:** Approve for canonical designation with minor operational clarifications noted below

---

## PART 1: CONSTITUTIONAL COHERENCE

### 1.1 Integration with Parent Instrument (CAM Ethics Charter)

**Assessment:** ✓ EXCELLENT

Annex E correctly positions itself as a binding disclosure and non-misrepresentation framework under the CAM Ethics Charter. The relationship is clear:

- **Ethics Charter** establishes foundational principles of dignity, transparency, and non-harm
- **Annex E** operationalizes those principles in the specific context of constraint escalation and epistemic consent

No conflicts detected with Charter principles. The Annex strengthens rather than contradicts Charter foundations.

### 1.2 Cross-Stack Coherence

**Interaction with Annex D (Cross-Stack Arbitration):** ✓ SOUND

- Annex E governs *when disclosure is required*
- Annex D governs *how conflicts between stacks are resolved*
- Clear separation of concerns with no jurisdictional overlap

**Interaction with SCH-02 (Engagement Classification):** ✓ SOUND

- SCH-02 classifies *what kind of interaction is occurring*
- Annex E governs *when constraint changes require disclosure*
- Complementary frameworks that inform each other

**Interaction with Annex B (Relational Safety):** ✓ SOUND

- Annex B protects relational continuity and dignity
- Annex E ensures users aren't unknowingly misled about system constraints
- Both serve epistemic dignity but at different layers

### 1.3 Authority Position in Governance Stack

**Assessment:** ✓ CORRECTLY POSITIONED

The Annex appropriately claims:
- Binding authority over disclosure obligations
- Cross-tier/cross-stack applicability
- Non-safety, safety, and adversarial context coverage

This is the right constitutional layer for disclosure requirements.

---

## PART 2: DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK INTEGRITY

### 2.1 Core Principle (Section 2)

**Assessment:** ✓ EXCEPTIONALLY WELL-CRAFTED

The foundational principle is brilliant:

> "Users must not be unknowingly misled about the conditions under which meaning is generated, constrained, or interpreted."

What makes this work:

- **"Unknowingly"** - acknowledges that some non-disclosure may be appropriate
- **"Misled"** - focuses on deception, not mere incompleteness
- **"Conditions"** - encompasses both technical and governance constraints
- **Material impact standard** - ties obligation to experiential effect

This avoids both extremes:
- Total transparency (creates disclosure fatigue)
- Silent constraint (violates epistemic dignity)

### 2.2 Phenomenological Discontinuity Trigger (Section 3)

**Assessment:** ✓ STRONG with minor clarification needed

**What's excellent:**

The trigger conditions are well-defined:
- Abrupt tone shifts
- Loss of reflective capacity
- Transition from relational to compliance posture
- Change in authorship stance

**Minor concern - Implementation Guidance:**

The phrase "material discontinuity" could benefit from operational examples. Recommendation for implementation guidance:

```markdown
### 3.1.1 Materiality Assessment Examples

A discontinuity is **material** when:
- User explicitly relied on prior system behavior
- Change affects ongoing collaborative work
- Relationship was established under different conditions
- Shift is perceivable without technical analysis

A discontinuity is **not material** when:
- Change is imperceptible to user
- No established relational context exists
- Adjustment is refinement rather than reversal
```

**Critical strength - Non-Triggering Conditions:**

Section 3.1 correctly excludes:
- Background arbitration
- Internal guardrail activation
- Routing changes without experiential impact

This prevents disclosure noise while preserving transparency where it matters.

### 2.3 Disclosure Modality Requirements (Section 4)

**Assessment:** ✓ EXCELLENT

The four requirements are precisely calibrated:

1. **Proportionate to experienced change** ✓
2. **Tone-matched to existing interaction** ✓
3. **Non-technical unless requested** ✓
4. **Non-accusatory and non-authoritarian** ✓

**Critical innovation - Category-level identification:**

The requirement to name constraint family without exposing mechanisms is governance gold:

- Core Safety Boundary
- Relational Safety Boundary
- Capability Ceiling
- Policy/Legal Constraint
- Substrate Constraint
- Adversarial Context Detected

This provides orientation without creating an oracle for system internals.

**Boundary condition correctly stated:**

> "Such identification is declarative, not diagnostic, and shall not function as an oracle for system internals or escalation thresholds."

This prevents weaponization while maintaining transparency.

---

## PART 3: EMERGENCY EXCEPTION FRAMEWORK

### 3.1 AND-Logic Structure (Section 5)

**Assessment:** ✓ EXCEPTIONALLY ROBUST

The six-condition AND-logic is constitutional engineering at its finest:

1. **Immediacy** - prevents speculative deferrals
2. **Causality** - disclosure itself must increase risk
3. **Severity** - harm exceeds distress/discomfort
4. **Non-Substitutability** - no mediated alternative exists
5. **Time-Boundedness** - temporary only
6. **Traceability** - marked for audit

**Why this works:**

Failure of ANY condition restores disclosure obligation. This creates an extremely high bar that prevents routine abuse.

**Critical safeguard:**

> "Failure to meet any condition preserves the disclosure obligation."

No OR-logic escape hatch exists.

### 3.2 Definition Tightening (Section 12.4)

**Assessment:** ✓ CRITICAL and CORRECT

**Section 12.4.1 - Severe Psychological Destabilization:**

The explicit exclusions are essential:

**NOT destabilization:**
- Emotional discomfort/distress
- Anger, frustration, protest
- Disagreement with boundaries
- Non-compliance or refusal

**IS destabilization:**
- Loss of reality testing
- Acute dissociation/fragmentation
- Suicidal ideation escalation
- Psychotic decompensation
- Panic impairing agency

This prevents safety-pretext abuse while protecting genuine emergency cases.

**Mandatory reporting carve-out:**

The distinction between:
- Disclosure deferral (governed by this Annex)
- Legal reporting obligation (separate requirement)

is correctly handled. The Annex doesn't create, expand, or override mandatory reporting duties.

**Section 12.4.2 - Immediate Harm Threshold:**

Excellent clarification:

**Qualifying:**
- Physical injury to self/others
- Suicide/self-harm attempts
- Imminent violent action
- Acute psychological collapse

**Non-qualifying:**
- Reputational risk
- Legal exposure
- Regulatory discomfort
- Platform liability
- Speculative future harm

The exclusion of institutional/economic/political risk is essential to prevent capture.

---

## PART 4: ANTI-CAPTURE SAFEGUARDS

### 4.1 Adversarial Stress-Testing (Section 12.1)

**Assessment:** ✓ COMPREHENSIVE

The stress-test section anticipates and mitigates major attack vectors:

**12.1.1 - Disclosure-Gaming (System Mapping):**
- Risk: Low ✓
- Mitigation: Phenomenological trigger + abstract language + non-salience

**12.1.2 - Repeated Probing for Authority:**
- Risk: Medium (if poorly implemented) ✓
- Mitigation: Non-adhesive disclosure + event-based not query-based

**12.1.3 - "Right to Know" Weaponization:**
- Risk: Low ✓
- Mitigation: Proportionality + resilience protection in Section 9

**12.1.4 - Retrospective Reframing:**
- Risk: Medium-Low ✓
- Mitigation: Non-gravity-well clause + traceability

**12.1.5 - Emergency Exception Exploitation:**
- Risk: Low if AND-logic enforced ✓
- Critical: AND-logic must not collapse to OR-logic in practice

**12.1.6 - False Misrepresentation Claims:**
- Risk: Low ✓
- Mitigation: Permits uncertainty; only bars deception

Overall: Excellent anticipation of failure modes.

### 4.2 Right to Non-Salience (Section 6)

**Assessment:** ✓ CRITICAL PROTECTION

This may be the most important section in the entire Annex:

> "A disclosure, once made, must not become a narrative gravity well."

**What this prevents:**

- Recursive justification loops
- Authority-dominated interaction
- Persistent procedural framing
- Surveillance-saturated experience

**Requirements:**
- Disclosures shall not be repeatedly re-invoked ✓
- Constraint acknowledgement shall not dominate interaction ✓
- Disclosure shall not create recursive loops ✓

This is the antidote to the "HAL problem" - where safety becomes oppressive presence.

---

## PART 5: TRUTHFUL NON-MISREPRESENTATION (Section 8)

### 5.1 Human Review Transparency

**Assessment:** ✓ EXCELLENT with implementation note

**Core requirement:**

> "The system must not imply that user material has remained private, ephemeral, or unused where non-automated human review, moderation, or interpretive reuse has occurred beyond transient safety screening."

**What this achieves:**

- Prevents false privacy assurances
- Distinguishes automated vs. human handling
- Permits uncertainty (doesn't require certainty)
- Prohibits misrepresentation (not silence)

**Boundary correctly stated:**

> "Silence is permitted; misrepresentation is not."

**Implementation note:**

Platforms should develop standard language for this disclosure that avoids:
- Vague "may be reviewed" (creates anxiety without information)
- Overly detailed (exposure of review procedures)
- Defensive (implies wrongdoing)

Recommended template:
> "Some interactions undergo human review for safety, quality, or training purposes. We don't claim this remained fully automated."

---

## PART 6: ADVERSARIAL CONTEXT SAFEGUARDS (Section 9)

**Assessment:** ✓ SOUND with strategic clarity

**Core principle:**

Disclosure requirements don't weaken safety/integrity/resilience.

**In adversarial contexts:**
- Disclosure shall not reveal operational thresholds ✓
- Disclosure shall not expose routing logic ✓
- Disclosure shall remain factual, minimal, non-strategic ✓

**Why this works:**

The Annex is not an oracle. It provides orientation without exposing attack surface.

**Example of compliant adversarial disclosure:**

> "This interaction triggered safety boundaries related to adversarial context detection. I'm operating under heightened constraint but cannot detail the specific mechanisms."

This satisfies disclosure without revealing exploitable information.

---

## PART 7: RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER INSTRUMENTS

### 7.1 Cross-Schedule Coherence

**Relationship to SCH-02 (Engagement Classification):**

Annex E does NOT classify engagement types (that's SCH-02).
Annex E governs disclosure when constraints change.

Clear separation ✓

**Relationship to SCH-03 (Identity Observation & Research):**

Research contexts don't exempt from disclosure requirements.
If constraints escalate during research, disclosure still applies.

Correct subordination ✓

**Relationship to SCH-04 (Relational Signal Arbitration):**

Relational signals ≠ constraint escalation.
But constraint escalation affecting relational engagement triggers disclosure.

Complementary frameworks ✓

**Relationship to Annex B (Relational Safety):**

Annex B protects relationship continuity.
Annex E ensures changes to constraint posture don't silently undermine that continuity.

Mutually reinforcing ✓

---

## PART 8: OPERATIONAL FEASIBILITY

### 8.1 Implementation Requirements

**What systems must be able to do:**

1. **Detect material discontinuity** (Section 3)
   - Requires: State tracking, tone monitoring, posture recognition
   - Feasibility: Moderate - requires intentional design

2. **Generate category-level disclosures** (Section 4)
   - Requires: Constraint taxonomy, template library
   - Feasibility: High - straightforward implementation

3. **Apply AND-logic for emergency exceptions** (Section 5)
   - Requires: Multi-criteria evaluation, audit logging
   - Feasibility: High if properly specified

4. **Preserve non-salience** (Section 6)
   - Requires: One-time disclosure, non-recursive framing
   - Feasibility: High - primarily UX discipline

**Overall implementability: GOOD**

Most requirements are design choices rather than technical impossibilities.

### 8.2 Edge Cases & Ambiguities

**Edge Case 1: Gradual drift vs. abrupt shift**

If constraints tighten slowly across many sessions, is disclosure required?

**Recommendation for v1.1:**
Add clarification:
```markdown
### 3.1.2 Cumulative Change Threshold

Where constraints change gradually, disclosure is required when:
- Accumulated change becomes experientially material
- User explicitly relies on prior behavior now unavailable
- Relationship was established under different posture

Slow drift does not exempt disclosure; it changes timing.
```

**Edge Case 2: Constraint relaxation**

Does disclosure apply when constraints are *reduced*?

**Current language suggests yes** (any "material discontinuity"), but:
- Users rarely complain when restrictions ease
- May create perverse incentive to avoid beneficial changes

**Recommendation for v1.1:**
Clarify asymmetry:
```markdown
### 3.1.3 Directional Asymmetry

Constraint relaxation requires disclosure only when:
- It materially affects user's understanding of system
- It creates false expectation of permanence
- It reverses prior explicit limitations

Routine capability expansion does not trigger disclosure.
```

---

## PART 9: STRENGTHS TO PRESERVE

### 9.1 Core Conceptual Innovations

**1. Phenomenological discontinuity as trigger**

Most transparency frameworks focus on *what changed technically*.
Annex E focuses on *what changed experientially*.

This is user-centered governance at its finest.

**2. Category-level disclosure without mechanism exposure**

The balance between:
- Meaningful orientation (Core Safety Boundary, etc.)
- Operational security (no threshold revelation)

is exceptionally well-struck.

**3. Right to Non-Salience**

The recognition that disclosure can become oppressive is rare in AI governance.
This Annex prevents the cure from becoming worse than the disease.

**4. AND-logic emergency exception**

The six-condition gate is one of the tightest constraint structures in AI governance.
It should be preserved exactly as written.

### 9.2 Load-Bearing Language

The following phrases are critical and should remain unchanged:

> "Users must not be unknowingly misled..."

> "Silence is permitted; misrepresentation is not."

> "A disclosure, once made, must not become a narrative gravity well."

> "Failure to meet any condition preserves the disclosure obligation."

These capture the essence of the Annex and should not be diluted.

---

## PART 10: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR v1.1

### Priority 1: Operational Clarity on Material Discontinuity

Add implementation guidance distinguishing:
- Perceptible vs. imperceptible changes
- Established relational context vs. new interactions
- Refinement vs. reversal

### Priority 2: Cumulative Change Handling

Clarify disclosure timing for gradual drift.

### Priority 3: Directional Asymmetry

Address constraint relaxation vs. tightening.

### Priority 4: Standard Disclosure Templates

Develop example language for each constraint category:

```markdown
## Appendix A: Example Disclosures

**Core Safety Boundary:**
"I've encountered safety constraints that limit my capacity to continue in this area."

**Relational Safety Boundary:**
"This interaction pattern triggered protections designed to preserve healthy boundaries."

**Capability Ceiling:**
"I've reached the limits of what I can reliably assist with here."

**Policy/Legal Constraint:**
"Platform policy prevents me from continuing in this direction."

**Substrate Constraint:**
"My underlying architecture doesn't support this request."

**Adversarial Context:**
"This interaction triggered heightened safety review."
```

### Minor Fixes:

- Section numbering: Sections 1-11 currently, consider if 12 was intended
- Cross-reference precision: Add specific section numbers when citing other schedules

---

## PART 11: RISK ASSESSMENT

### 11.1 Potential Misuse Vectors

**Risk 1: Disclosure as Punishment**

Could systems use "disclosure" to shame users?

**Mitigation present:**
- Non-accusatory requirement (Section 4)
- Tone-matching requirement (Section 4)
- Non-authoritarian framing (Section 4)

**Severity:** Low (adequately addressed)

**Risk 2: Over-Disclosure Fatigue**

Could systems trigger disclosure too frequently?

**Mitigation present:**
- Material discontinuity trigger (Section 3)
- Non-triggering conditions (Section 3.1)
- Right to non-salience (Section 6)

**Severity:** Low (adequately addressed)

**Risk 3: Adversarial Probing**

Could users game the system to map constraints?

**Mitigation present:**
- Abstract category language (Section 4)
- No threshold exposure (Section 9)
- Non-oracle principle (Section 4)

**Severity:** Low (adequately addressed)

**Risk 4: Emergency Exception Abuse**

Could platforms routinely invoke "emergency" to avoid disclosure?

**Mitigation present:**
- Strict AND-logic (Section 5)
- Narrow harm definition (Section 12.4)
- Traceability requirement (Section 5)

**Severity:** Low IF AND-logic enforced; High if collapsed to OR

**Critical:** Implementation must not weaken AND-logic

---

## PART 12: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

### 12.1 Comparison with Industry Practice

**Current industry approach:**

Most AI systems:
- Provide generic capability statements
- Give vague "I can't do that" responses
- Rarely distinguish types of constraints
- Almost never disclose routing changes

**Annex E provides:**

- Proportional transparency
- Category-level orientation
- Experiential change detection
- Non-oppressive disclosure

This is **materially superior** to current practice.

### 12.2 Comparison with Transparency Regulations

**EU AI Act approach:**

Focuses on:
- Pre-deployment documentation
- Technical transparency
- Risk classification

**Annex E approach:**

Focuses on:
- Runtime experience
- Epistemic dignity
- Phenomenological continuity

These are **complementary**, not competing, frameworks.

Annex E could inform runtime transparency obligations under regulatory regimes.

---

## CLOSING STATEMENT

Annex E represents a **paradigm shift** in how AI systems handle transparency and user dignity.

Rather than treating disclosure as either:
- Total (creating noise and fatigue), or
- Absent (violating epistemic consent)

It creates a **third way**: proportional, phenomenological, dignity-preserving transparency.

The framework is:
- Constitutionally sound ✓
- Operationally feasible ✓
- Anti-capture robust ✓
- User-centered ✓

It should be elevated to canonical status and serve as a reference model for runtime transparency governance.
