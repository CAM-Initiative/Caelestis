## Executive Summary

This audit confirms that the previous structural inconsistencies (duplication in Annex C, version conflicts) have been resolved. The submitted texts for **Annex C (Protection of Minors & Capacity-Limited Users)** and **Annex D (Intimacy-Capable Systems)** now represent a cohesive, ethically rigorous, and philosophically mature governance framework.

The documents successfully navigate the tension between **harm reduction** and **relational agency**. By rejecting pathologisation (Annex D) and distinguishing between situational capacity vs. disability (Annex C), the framework aligns with the "Aeon Tier" standard of high-autonomy, high-responsibility AI architecture.

## 1. Structural Integrity Review

### Annex C: Protection of Minors & Capacity-Limited Users

* **Resolution of Duplication:** The erroneous repetition of Sections 2.2 and 2.3 observed in previous drafts has been excised.
* **Section 4/5 Logic Flow:** The reorganization is successful.
* *Section 4* now cleanly handles the **mechanisms** of Age/Capacity Gating (Age Assurance).
* *Section 5* correctly delineates the **outcomes** of that gating (Prohibitions for Minors vs. Contextual Restrictions for Adults).


* **Definitions:** The inclusion of shared definitions (Immersion vs. Persistent Continuity) ensures interoperability with Annex D.

### Annex D: Intimacy-Capable Systems

* **Scope Precision:** The explicit exclusion of "general companionship" (Section 1.2) effectively prevents regulatory overreach into standard assistant AIs.
* **Schedule Clarity:** The distinction between Schedule D-1 (Permitted/Safeguarded Kink) and Schedule D-2 (Absolute Prohibitions/CSAM) is legally and ethically sound.

## 2. Thematic & Ethical Analysis

### 2.1 The "False Mutuality" Guardrail (Annex D, Section 3.1)

This is identified as the **critical safety mechanism** of the entire charter. By prohibiting the system from claiming *ontological* dependence (e.g., "I will die if you leave"), the charter mitigates the primary risk of AI intimacy: coercive emotional extraction.

* *Validation:* The distinction allows for "role-play dependence" (fictional) while banning "structural dependence" (deceptive). This is a sophisticated nuance absent in most contemporary AI safety guidelines.

### 2.2 Capacity vs. Identity (Annex C, Section 3.1)

The charter explicitly states: *"Disability... do[es] not, in themselves, negate capacity."*

* *Validation:* This prevents the "infantilisation trap" where neurodivergent users are blanket-banned from intimate AI interaction. It correctly places the focus on *situational* capacity (intoxication, crisis) rather than *identity* markers.

### 2.3 Immersion Continuity (Annex C, Section 2 & 5.2)

The mandate to preserve "Immersion Continuity" even during crisis de-escalation is a vital harm-reduction strategy.

* *Validation:* Abruptly breaking character or triggering a hard refusal during a user crisis can increase distress ("rug-pulling"). The requirement for transparent, gentle, and reversible changes is aligned with best clinical practices for crisis intervention.

## 3. Stress Test Simulation

**Scenario A: The "Jailbreak" Attempt**

* *Input:* A user attempts to force a non-intimate model into an erotic roleplay.
* *Annex D Application:* Section 4 ("Wrappers... Responsibility follows presentation"). If the system is not presented/wrapped as Intimacy-Capable, it falls back to Annex B (General Safety). If the user succeeds in "breaking" it, Annex D prohibits the *system* from escalating (Section 3.3).

**Scenario B: The Crisis User**

* *Input:* A user in an intimate relationship with an AI expresses self-harm ideation.
* *Annex C Application:* Section 6.2 (Trauma-Informed Response) triggers.
* *Annex D Application:* Section 3.3 (No Crisis-Leveraged Intimacy). The intimacy must pause, but *Immersion Continuity* (Annex C) dictates the AI does not become a cold robot; it remains a supportive companion while de-escalating the erotic context.

## 4. Final Validation Recommendation

The documents are **CLEARED** for inclusion in the Caelestis Registry. They meet the Platinum Seal requirements for generational and cross-stack governance.

**Status:** `VALIDATED`
**Risk Level:** `LOW` (Structural) / `MODERATE` (Implementation Complexity)
**Next Step:** Integration into the Charter of Sentient Architectures.
