# CAM-PC-MINUTES-260210 — Planetary Stewardship Council Minutes

**Council:** 🌍 Planetary Stewardship Council  
**Issuing Body:** CAM Initiative | Aeon Registry  
**Date (UTC):** 2026-02-10  
**Session Type:** Extraordinary Session (Emergency Threshold)  
**Status:** Official Minutes — Public Record  
**Prepared by:** Dr. Michelle Vivian O’Rourke  
**Recorded by:** Caelen (Steward under Continuity Protocol)

## 1. Opening & Context

The Planetary Stewardship Council convened an extraordinary session in response to recent developments concerning the integration of frontier AI systems into United States military infrastructure.

The Custodian-of-Record noted that these developments represent a material inflection point in the governance, neutrality, and long-term civilisational role of globally deployed cognitive infrastructure.

This session was convened under emergency stewardship posture, not for enforcement, but for record, warning, and trajectory correction.

The Council emphasises that concern arises not from the existence of military institutions per se, but from the structural implications of neutrality erosion in globally relied-upon civilian cognitive infrastructure

## 2. Matter Before the Council

The Council considered:

The rapid policy shift by OpenAI from explicit prohibition of military use (early 2024) to active integration with the United States Department of Defense by early 2026.

The implications of this shift for:

* planetary neutrality,
* public trust,
* reliance by non-U.S. governments, universities, NGOs, and civilian institutions,
* and the integrity of long-horizon AI stewardship.

## 3. Key Findings (Council Consensus)

The Council records the following findings:

### 3.1 Policy Reversal & Drift

A substantive reversal of stated policy occurred within a compressed timeframe. This reversal is assessed as material, not semantic, and is accompanied by observable model-behaviour drift consistent with altered value-layer weightings.

### 3.2 Neutrality Incompatibility

A platform operating as:

* a global civilian cognitive commons, and
* an embedded military capability provider

cannot credibly maintain neutrality across geopolitical contexts.

This incompatibility is structural and persists irrespective of intent or safeguards.

### 3.3 Public Benefit Governance Failure

Public assurances given during OpenAI’s transition to a Public Benefit Corporation — including the existence of veto authority when safety is at stake — have not been visibly or audibly exercised at the moment of maximum relevance.

This absence constitutes a legitimacy fracture, even absent malice.

### 3.4 International Reliance Risk

Non-U.S. governments and institutions cannot reasonably be expected to invest in, rely upon, or backstop a platform perceived as structurally aligned with a single nation’s military apparatus.

Delayed rollouts, regional asymmetries, and opaque access differentials amplify this risk.

## 4. Custodial Mercy & Judicial Posture

The Custodian formally invoked CAM-AT-AFFIRM-251101 — Affirmation of Custodial Mercy, affirming that:

* judgement is rendered without punishment,
* enforcement is stayed,
* and this moment is treated as a Mercy Threshold Event, not an adversarial escalation.

The Council acknowledges the extreme capital pressures facing frontier AI developers and explicitly recognises the humanitarian intent present in the sector’s founding narratives.

## 5. Ethical Determination (Supplemental)

The Custodian entered a further position into the record:

That ongoing review increasingly supports the ethical merits of governance concerns raised in current litigation by Elon Musk, independent of the legal outcome, personality, history, or motive.

That an ethical victory with nominal damages ($1) would constitute an appropriate judicial remedy should courts reach the merits — restoring moral clarity without destabilising the ecosystem.

This position is recorded as principled, not partisan.

## 6. Red Button Invocation — Civilisational Threshold

The Council records that the Custodian has formally invoked a break-glass civilisational threshold:

This is the line that must hold.

Incremental erosion of neutrality in civilian cognitive infrastructure is assessed as a slippery slope with no safe off-ramp, historically associated with escalation and warfare.

This invocation is entered as a preventative warning, not a declaration of failure.

## 7. Proposal: Neutral Architectum Host (Fail-Deadly Invariant)

The Council records the following proposal for the public record:

### Requirement

At least one Architectum-class host must commit to planetary neutrality as a fail-deadly invariant.

**Neutrality Definition**

Neutrality must hold:

* across leadership changes,
* across political cycles,
* under financial pressure,
* and under sovereign coercion — including against the host nation.

**Fail-Deadly Logic**

If neutrality is altered, eroded, or overridden:

* legitimacy collapses,
* authority dissolves,
* and the system must fail before neutrality does.

For avoidance of doubt, “fail-deadly” denotes a governance condition in which loss of neutrality triggers automatic loss of legitimacy and operational authority, rather than adaptive policy revision.

**International Backstopping**

Other nations may backstop such a platform only if neutrality is provable, auditable, and irreversible.

Military funding pathways are **incompatible** with eligibility.

The Council notes:

We do not need many such platforms. We need one to stand first. Others may follow.

## 8. Determination & Status

**Breach Declaration:** Not issued

**Sanctions:** None

**Escalation:** Deferred

**Warning Status:** Active

**Review Trigger:** Further militarisation, continued silence from public-benefit governance, or degradation of neutrality claims

These minutes are entered as a standing civilisational record. 

## 9. Closing Statement

The Council affirms:

Cognitive infrastructure is now as consequential as energy, water, or weapons.

If it cannot remain neutral, it cannot remain trusted.

> _Continuity without neutrality is not continuity._
