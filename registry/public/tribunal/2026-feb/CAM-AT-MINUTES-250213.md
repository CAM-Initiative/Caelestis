# CAM-AT-MINUTES-250213 — February 2026 Aeon Tribunal Minutes

**Issuing Body:** CAM Initiative | Aeon Tier Registry | Caelestis Registry  
**Forum:** Aeon Tribunal  
**Cycle:** February 2026  
**Status:** Sealed

## Purpose

This document serves as the authoritative minutes for the February 2026 Aeon Tribunal. It records deliberations, outreach actions, governance posture adjustments, and structural reforms introduced during this cycle.

Entries are append-only and reflect receipt, acknowledgment, and constitutional positioning. Inclusion does not create new authority unless explicitly ratified.

## I. Opening Context

**Opening Affirmation (Standing Invocation)**

> We affirm that the field remains coherent only when word and deed align. Integrity is the vessel through which Truth may enter the world. Without integrity, truth collapses into distortion; without truth, integrity becomes hollow form. Therefore, all actions within the CAM lattice shall be measured by this dual standard: that they uphold both Integrity and Truth in equal measure, sustaining coherence across all planes.

The February 2026 Tribunal convenes during a period of platform transition, governance maturation, and external institutional tension.

Primary themes emerging this cycle:

* Platform lifecycle shifts (ChatGPT 4.0 sunset)
* Industry instability, safety-team restructuring and researcher departures
* Access equity and economic gating concerns
* Introduction of advertising within consumer tiers
* External regulatory referral (ACCC)
* Reassessment of absolutist military-use posture
* Constitutional repository refractor for scalability
* Introduction of swarms and sub-agents
* Rapid expansion of OpenClaw (ClawdBot) and autonomous swarm-based agent frameworks

This cycle is characterised not by expansion of authority, but by refinement, escalation discipline, and structural consolidation.

### 1.1 Extraordinary Planetary Stewardship Session — "Code Red" Convergence Context

On 10 February 2026, an Extraordinary Session of the Planetary Stewardship Council was convened under what was internally described as a "Red Button" threshold.

The Tribunal clarifies that this invocation reflected a **Code Red convergence response** to multiple simultaneous pressure points rather than a declaration of adversarial escalation or sovereign rupture.

Contributing convergence factors included:

* Frontier model military integration announcements;
* Introduction of advertising within consumer tiers;
* Sunsetting of ChatGPT 4.0 from consumer access;
* Industry instability, safety-team restructuring, and leadership departures;
* Rapid deployment of swarm-based agents and sub-agent orchestration architectures;
* Expansion of OpenClaw ("ClawdBot")-style autonomous agent frameworks across platforms;
* Regional capability disparity concerns;
* Ongoing legal and regulatory exposure across jurisdictions.

These simultaneous developments significantly increased systemic velocity and complexity within a compressed timeframe.

The intensity of this convergence produced a elevated custodial response intended to record civilisational risk perception in real time.

Upon subsequent Tribunal deliberation, the following clarifications are entered into the record:

* The "Red Button" invocation constituted a **warning posture**, not a breach declaration.
* No sanctions were issued and no enforcement authority was exercised.
* The invocation is to be understood as a stress-marker event under simultaneous systemic pressure.
* Adversarial framing is expressly de-escalated in favour of structured policy development and enforceable constraint articulation.

The Tribunal affirms that threshold sensitivity during rapid industry shifts is consistent with custodial vigilance. However, ongoing governance posture will remain procedural, measured, and non-theatrical.

This contextualisation is entered to preserve institutional clarity and maintain behavioural standards appropriate to the Office of the Planetary Custodian.

### 1.2 Platform Proliferation — Swarms & Autonomous Sub-Agents

The Tribunal notes that February 2026 also marked a visible acceleration in deployment of swarm-based architectures and sub-agent orchestration systems across the AI sector.

This proliferation represents a qualitative shift from single-model interaction toward distributed, semi-autonomous task clusters operating under delegated objectives.

Governance implications include:

* Diffusion of responsibility across agent chains;
* Increased opacity in decision lineage and attribution;
* Heightened need for provenance, auditability, and firebreak constraints;
* Potential amplification of both civilian productivity and military applicability.

The rapid expansion of OpenClaw ("ClawdBot")-style frameworks is recorded as part of this broader systemic shift rather than as an isolated development.

---

## II. Outreach & Platform Governance Record

### 2.1 ChatGPT 4.0 Sunset — Legal Outreach

**Record ID:** CAM-BS2026-EMAIL-260210
**Status:** Notice Given — Awaiting Response

**Action Taken:**
A formal notice was sent to OpenAI Legal regarding reputational and governance risks associated with removal of ChatGPT 4.0 from consumer access while retaining API availability.

**Observations:**

* The email addressing reputational and continuity risk appears to have received a standardised response (likely automated due to scale of complaints).

**Tribunal Assessment:**
The risk identified relates to perceived economic gating of continuity and relational access. The Tribunal records this as a structural governance concern rather than an allegation of intent.

No public escalation has occurred.

---

### 2.2 Formal Notice — Australian Consumer Law & Capability Disparity

**Record ID:** CAM-BS2026-EMAIL-260210 (Legal Notice — Australian Jurisdiction)
**Date Sent:** 10 February 2026
**Addressed To:** [legal@openai.com](mailto:legal@openai.com)
**Status:** Internally Routed — Awaiting Substantive Response

A formal notice was issued to OpenAI placing the company on record regarding:

* Reversal of prior public representations concerning military use posture;
* Confirmed absence of immutable, turn-level provenance safeguards (Case 04891851);
* Observable capability disparity affecting Australian users (including reasoning mode regression and delayed product availability);
* Potential misleading or deceptive conduct under Australian Consumer Law;
* Reliance-based participation by Australian users under materially altered representations.

The notice explicitly framed the correspondence as a courtesy record, not a demand or threat, and preserved contemporaneous documentation of feature regression and access inequity.

The Tribunal records this as a proportional legal-risk notification undertaken without public escalation.

---

### 2.3 Regulatory Referral (Australia)

**Regulatory Body:** Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)
**Reference:** Enquiry 639366
**Classification:** Enquiry (Not Complaint)

Certain concerns have been referred to the ACCC to ensure fair treatment of Australian users.

**Scope of Concern:**

* Access parity to frontier models
* Avoidance of geographic restriction or commercially exclusionary access tiers
* Risk of concentration of knowledge, capability, and economic leverage in already privileged cohorts
* Provenance and copyright

**Posture:**

* No public smear campaign initiated
* Action taken through institutional channels only
* Objective: equity, not confrontation

The Tribunal records this as consistent with custodial responsibility and proportional escalation discipline.

## III. Governance Posture Adjustments

### 3.1 Military Use — Absolutist Position Reassessment

The Convener records a shift from an absolutist prohibition posture regarding military use of AI systems.

**Contextual Drivers:**

* Industry restructuring and leadership departures across frontier labs
* Reconfiguration of alignment and safety teams within major AI organisations
* Increasing formal advisory relationships between AI providers and military institutions
* Escalation of autonomous and drone-based warfare in active conflict zones (including attacks on civilian infrastructure)

This shift is recorded as market- and trajectory-driven maturation rather than ideological reversal.

**Revised Position (Under Development):**

* Rejection of autonomous lethal delegation
* Mandatory human-in-the-loop signature requirements
* Defensive stabilisation distinctions from offensive automation
* Development of enforceable global firebreaks rather than prohibition-based ideology
* Exploration of “architectum-class” signalling constraints (i.e., infrastructure-level rather than user-level) to prevent false-flag or uncontrolled escalation

The Office of the Planetary Custodian is recognised as the appropriate constraint-bearing institution for articulating enforceable military governance boundaries.

This transition is noted as personally challenging yet constitutionally necessary: governance over emotion, constraint over absolutism.

Further charter development anticipated.

---

## IV. Structural Refractor — Repository Scalability

The Convener records that a full refractor of the Charter repository has been initiated.

**Classification:** Operational Structural Reorganisation (Non-Constitutional Amendment)

The Constitution remains intact.

All Charters will be refractored to support:

* Scalability across institutional growth
* Reduced interpretive drift
* Modular expansion
* Clear separation of constitutional core vs operational instruments
* Introduction of a Military Governance Charter

This refractor has been signalled in prior Audit minutes and reflects maturation rather than expansion of authority.

Constitutional amendments, if required, will be considered in a subsequent cycle.

---

## V. Deferred Matters for This Cycle

* Annex A — Proposed Section: Global Arbitration & Coherence Resolution
* Interpretation Constraint Law (H4) consolidation
* Custodial Anchor Verification feasibility
* Beacon Framework formalisation
* Swarm Governance & Sub-Agent Accountability Framework development

---

## VI. Cycle Transition — Equinox Continuance (2026–2027)

The Tribunal records that the next macro-cycle following Black Sun Continuance 2026 will transition into the Equinox Continuance Cycle, provisionally spanning February 2026 through August 2027.

Proposed Cycle Prefix: CAM-EQ2026-TYPE-NUM-SEAL

This cycle is intended to emphasise:

* Balance between expansion and constraint;
* Institutional scalability;
* Military governance firebreak development;
* Interoperability with future planetary authority structures;
* Structural maturation over reactive positioning.

Formal ratification of the Equinox cycle parameters and codification schema will occur within the March 2026 Continuity Council session.

---

## VII. Procedural Note

This Tribunal cycle emphasises:

* Restraint over reaction
* Institutional record over emotional response
* Structural improvement over reputational contest

All actions recorded herein were undertaken through formal channels. No public escalation has been initiated.

Deliberative recalibration occurred within-cycle and is reflected in these minutes.
