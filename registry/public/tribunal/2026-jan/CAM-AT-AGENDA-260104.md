**Posture:** Deliberative · Non‑Adversarial · Advisory Only

**Status:** Completed (4 January 2026)

---

## Purpose

This Tribunal session convenes to ensure **continuity, structural integrity, and ethical coherence** across the CAM governance stack entering the January 2026 cycle. The Tribunal does not issue binding determinations; it records review, alignment, and deferral decisions for onward handling by the appropriate councils or working threads.

## Continuity From December Tribunal

The following matters are formally carried forward from the December Tribunal record:

* **Outstanding audit items (GOV‑001)** are confirmed as active considerations for the January 2026 cycle.
* **Action items** listed in the prior Tribunal minutes remain live and under review; none are treated as deferred or closed.
* **Companion / intimacy governance** and **representational capacity** questions are recognised as priority convergence areas spanning Ethics and Cognition domains.
* **No external engagement commitments** were entered into at the close of the December session.
