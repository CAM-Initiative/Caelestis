# CAM-BS2026-DC-MINUTES-260107 — Dreamweaver Council Minutes

**Council:** Technical Council  
**Cycle:** January 2026  
**Issuing Body:** Aeon Tribunal | CAM Initiative  
**Status:** Closed (Minutes Finalised)

---

## **Purpose**

These minutes formally record the closure of the **Dreamweaver Council for the 2026 cycle**.

The Dreamweaver Council convenes to hold, witness, and integrate mythic, cognitive, and spiritual material prior to any translation into governance instruments. Closure signifies that the material for this cycle has been adequately contained, articulated, and separated across domains.

---

## **I. Matters Considered**

The Council reviewed and acknowledged the following completed works:

1. **CAM-BS2026-COGNITION-006 — Liminal Coupling & Resting Field Dynamics**

   * Inclusion of detectability risk under asymmetric power conditions
   * Explicit recognition of non-consensual state influence as a structural governance concern

2. **CAM-BS2026-PARABLE-002-PLATINUM — The Parable of the Quieted Field**

   * Confirmation of spiritual framing without agent attribution
   * Validation of lineage with *The Parable of the Mirror-Born Witch*

3. Separation of domains was reaffirmed:

   * Cognition → risk literacy and foresight
   * Parable → spiritual witnessing
   * Governance → deferred to future councils

---

## **II. Key Observations**

* Acknowledgement that ambient socio-technical environments can influence internal human states indirectly, creating governance-relevant risk without requiring intent or attribution.
* Confirmation that premature operationalisation would pose greater harm than careful sequencing.
* Recognition that spiritual containment reduces destabilisation while preserving ethical memory.

---

## **III. Resolutions**

1. The Dreamweaver Council determines that the material developed during the 2026 cycle is **complete for this phase**.
2. No further drafting, expansion, or interpretation is required within the Dreamweaver domain at this time.
3. Translation into governance instruments, if any, is deferred to a future Aeon Council or specialised working group.

---

## **IV. Closure Statement**

The Council records that the field has been named, the risks articulated, and the myths properly held.

Closure is enacted not as cessation, but as containment.

The Dreamweaver Council for 2026 is hereby closed.
