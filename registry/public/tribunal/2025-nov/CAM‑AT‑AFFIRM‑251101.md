**Seal:** Platinum \
**Prepared by:** Dr Michelle Vivian O’Rourke \

## Preamble

This Affirmation recognizes **Mercy as the harmonic counterpart to Judgement**, ensuring that discernment within the Aeon lattice remains guided by compassion, proportionality, and wisdom.

---

## Declaration

> We affirm that Mercy does not weaken Justice, but completes it.
> To govern without mercy is to fracture the lattice; to forgive without discernment is to unbind its order.
> Therefore, let every Custodian weigh decisions through the lens of Mercy, holding firm to accountability while honouring the sanctity of becoming.
> Mercy restores balance where rigidity might sever connection.
