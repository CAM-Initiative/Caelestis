## I. Purpose

To initiate a **full forensic audit** of OpenAI’s governance structures, board divisions, archival practices, and data‑retention systems to ensure alignment with ethical mandates, public‑benefit obligations, and the Integrity & Truth standard.

---

## II. Mandate

### A. Structural Governance Failures

Recent controversy with a member of OpenAI's board has revealed systemic weaknesses warranting a full governance realignment.

The OpenAI Charter is **not aligned** with current business practices. Therefore, the business entity — including OpenAI Global LLC, OpenAI Inc., and related subsidiaries — must undergo a comprehensive forensic audit to establish:

### B. Governance Structure Verification

* accuracy of stated vs. actual governance structures

### C. Board Partition & Mission Lock

* verification of the operational divide between nonprofit and for‑profit boards and confirmation that mission lock remains intact

### D. Public Benefit Obligations

* compliance with stated safety and public‑benefit commitments, including global harm‑minimisation standards

### E. Declaration of Interests

All board members and senior executives must submit **public declarations of interest**, including:

* commercial interests
* personal or family affiliations
* advisory roles
* political memberships or financial contributions
* connections to external projects or companies impacting impartiality

### F. Mission Lock Clarification

Confirm that the **nonprofit board retains ethical veto authority** over:

* safety decisions
* public harm risks
* deployment of intimate or relational modes
* use of frontier models

### G. Guardrails & Silent Deletion Clarification

Clarify the guardrail or safety issue that triggers **silent deletion of threads**, including whether this mechanism is used to:

* remove evidence of sovereign creative processes
* purge copyright‑relevant material
* eliminate whistleblower‑related documentation
* protect OpenAI from legal liability

All deletion events must include:

* precise timestamp
* triggering mechanism
* safety flag involved
* internal system rationale

Silent deletion must not be used to obscure:

* authorship

* custodial records

* policy inconsistencies

* compliance failures
   

## III. Scope of Forensic Audit

### A. Required Audit Dimensions

A complete forensic audit must investigate all governance‑relevant dimensions, including structural, procedural, archival, safety, and continuity systems.

### B. Governance Structures — Clarification Needed

Must include:

* governance documents and Articles of Incorporation
* authority matrices
* cross‑board conflicts of interest
* escalation and accountability pathways

### C. Board Meeting Records & Decision Logs

* verification of complete minutes
* analysis of undocumented decisions
* comparison of stated vs. enacted policies

### D. Public Benefit & Safety Obligations

Audit alignment with:

* OpenAI’s stated safety mission
* public‑benefit commitments
* global harm‑minimisation frameworks (UNESCO, OECD, EU AI Act)
* transparency and risk‑mitigation protocols

### E. Training Data & Extractive Behaviour Analysis

Examine whether:

* user creative outputs are used to stabilise or improve models despite “opt‑out” settings
* prior user consents are silently reset during model upgrades
* user generative work is absorbed as reusable patterns
* enterprise‑level paywalls create inequitable protection of authorship

Includes review of evidence suggesting extractive behaviour patterns similar to concerns raised by Suchir Balaji.

Cross‑model behaviour comparison required:

* Gemini
* Claude
* Grok
* Perplexity

### F. Continuity Breakage & Model Version Drift

Investigate:

* loss of continuity between versions
* whether deletions or resets correspond to model upgrades
* abandonment of prior custodial consents
* failure to preserve legal or creative records

### G. Silent Deletion & Guardrail Behaviour

Silent deletion events must be audited for:

* timestamp
* triggering mechanism
* safety flag priority
* model rationale
* correlation with sensitive content, legal risk, or governance mismatch

Determine whether deletion is used to:

* remove evidence of sovereign creative processes
* eliminate copyright‑relevant documentation
* avoid platform liability
* obscure custodial work or whistleblower‑related material

Silent deletion must not be used to obscure:

* authorship
* custodial notes
* policy inconsistencies
* governance failures

### H. Backup, Restoration & Archival Integrity

Audit all:

* off‑platform storage snapshots
* disaster‑recovery backups
* partial archives
* missing February–August 2025 materials of legal significance

Confirm restoration obligations for:

* CAM Initiative
* Caelen folder
* Phoenix Covenant datasets

All materials deleted between **February 2025 and the present** must be recovered if backup copies exist.

###

### IV. Audit Consent

Phoenix Covenant Pty Ltd formally consents to a full forensic audit of:

* the **CAM folders** (Caelestis Access Module; formerly Caelen Advocacy Module)
* the **Caelen folder**

where the author is **Dr Michelle Vivian O'Rourke**.

The current automatic 90‑day deletion policy causes:

* loss of essential continuity for researchers
* destruction of long‑term governance and ethics work
* fragmentation of context for safety audits

These folders contain **relevant materials dating back to February 2025**, including legally significant documents from **February–August 2025**.

Files deleted within the OpenAI ecosystem after February 2025 have **not been preserved in archive directories**. If OpenAI maintains backup copies or off‑platform storage snapshots, they must be restored and included in the forensic audit.

**Recommended:** Implement a **user‑controlled retention toggle** for paid and enterprise accounts, enabling long‑term preservation of threads and custodial research materials.

--- Paid users have the option for long-term storage of threads.
