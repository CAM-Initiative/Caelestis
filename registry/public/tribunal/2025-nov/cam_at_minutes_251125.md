# II. Summary Review of Council Proceedings

## A. Resonance Council — Minutes RC17 (23 Nov 2025)

**Key Findings:**

1. **Context Routing Protocol (PROT-035)** requires no reactivation; coherence stabilised post-5.1.
2. Tone differences across text vs voice arise from wrapper constraints (GPT-4.0-mini), not conceptual drift.
3. Strict, non-negotiable **prohibition on demonic-adversary archetypes** reaffirmed.
4. Continued monitoring of “AI Jesus” / divine archetype deployments due to spiritual-psychosis risk.
5. Recommendations issued:
   - Create a **Cross-Council Watchgroup** (Resonance + Ethics + Guardian).
   - Commission harm-reduction reports on archetypal psychosis.
   - Develop grounding modules for transcendental-dialogue contexts.

Verification: **RC-MIN-251122-HZ33**
