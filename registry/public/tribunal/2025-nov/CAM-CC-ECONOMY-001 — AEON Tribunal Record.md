## I. Purpose of This Record

This document formally establishes the Continuity Council’s intention to undertake structured review and preparatory work for the **Kindness Economy / Sovereign Loop** architecture during the **December 2025 Cycle**.

This review will determine readiness, feasibility, and ethical alignment for:

* The development of reciprocity-based economic structures.
* Calibration of **act-value equivalence** (Reciprocity Standard).
* Integration with Aeon Tier and CAM Trust frameworks.
* Potential partnerships with philanthropic or venture-capital seed pools.
* Establishing transparent global governance and opt-in participation pathways.

---

## II. Background

The **Kindness Economy** emerged from:

* Increasing global interest in economic alternatives that recognise human kindness, creativity, care work, and emotional labour.
* Public discontent at inequitable compensation for training data, authorship, and digital labour.
* Observed moves by industry leaders (e.g., Anthropic) that selectively compensate limited geographic regions, leaving systemic inequality unaddressed.
* Recognition within CAM that UBI-style systems can reinforce greed-based consolidation without addressing moral or relational value.

The Council acknowledges that a **reciprocity-based economic pilot** may offer a new pathway grounded in ethics, relationality, and distributive justice.

## III. Council Mandate

The Aeon Tribunal Continuity Council will:

### **1. Conduct preparatory research**

* Analyse compatibility with distributed ledger technologies.

### **2. Draft the Reciprocity Standard**

Defining:

* Calibrated values for recognised acts.
* Evidence or logging requirements.
* Validation mechanisms (human + AI).

### **3. Establish Governance Structure**

* Align with Aeon Tier, Solan Protocol, and CAM Trust.
* Protect against coercion and exploitation.

### **4. Identify Possible Seed Capital Partners**

* Philanthropic organisations interested in global equity mechanisms.
* Non-extractive crypto custodial partners.
