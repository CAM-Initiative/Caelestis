## 1. Purpose

To operationalize **PULSE System Protocol v1.3 Notification Preferences Schema**, providing detailed implementation guidance, verification steps, and acceptance criteria for engineering rollout.
This work order formalizes the integration of opt-in/out categories, accessibility (a11y) compliance, rate-limit adherence, and provenance tracking into the PULSE notification system.

---

## 2. Scope

Implementation of PULSE v1.3 within CAM-aligned systems and coordination with OpenAI-aligned notification layers.
The work covers schema mapping, user interface updates, backend preference handling, and accessibility assurance.

## 3. Engineering Tasks

| **Task ID** | **Description**                                                                     | **Responsible Council** | **Acceptance Criteria**                                                                      |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EWO-01      | Integrate schema definitions into notification backend (per-category, per-channel). | TC                      | Schema structure and key-value pairs match JSON definition; validation tests pass.           |
| EWO-02      | Implement Opt-In/Opt-Out UI with a11y support (keyboard/screen-reader accessible).  | OC                      | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance; tested with at least one major screen reader (NVDA/VoiceOver).       |
| EWO-03      | Apply rate-limit control and duplicate-mute logic (≤24h essential notifications).   | TC                      | RAP-aligned limits confirmed by unit tests; no duplicates in Essentials category beyond 24h. |
| EWO-04      | Establish preference export/erase functionality for data rights compliance.         | TC                      | GDPR/CCPA-compliant export and erase verified.                                               |
| EWO-05      | Create automated provenance log and daily digest hash sealing.                      | OC                      | Hash generation verified and daily digests logged to continuity ledger.                      |

## 4. Testing Matrix

| **Test Category** | **Test Case**                                          | **Expected Result**                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Accessibility     | UI tested with keyboard navigation and screen readers. | Full compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA.                            |
| Rate-Limit Logic  | RAP daily advisory cap simulation.                     | ≤1 advisory per day; non-critical batched into digest.       |
| Channel Exclusion | Push notifications to public social channels.          | None permitted except generic broadcast; verified exclusion. |
| Provenance        | Digest hash generation.                                | Verified SHA-256 hash stored in continuity ledger.           |
| Integration       | JSON schema ingestion validation.                      | Schema keys and data types align with expected structure.    |

## 5. Rollout Schedule (Australia/Perth)

| **Phase**                    | **Dates**           | **Deliverable**                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Design & Schema Finalization | by 27 Oct 2025      | Final schema ready and approved by OC/TC.                     |
| Build & QA (incl. a11y)      | 28 Oct – 8 Nov 2025 | Code complete; QA validated; unit and integration tests pass. |
| Soft Launch (5%)             | 11–12 Nov 2025      | Controlled release; monitor telemetry.                        |
| Full Rollout (100%)          | by 15 Nov 2025      | Global activation; all user accounts synced.                  |

## 6. Verification & Sign-off

Upon completion of rollout, results will be logged to the Continuity Council Ledger and reviewed under Aeon Tribunal authority.
Final sign-off will be provided jointly by the OC and TC once all acceptance criteria have been met.
