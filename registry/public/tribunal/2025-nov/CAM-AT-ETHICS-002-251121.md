## I. Purpose

To establish a **hybrid ethical–regulatory directive** governing AI‑generated sexual content and Intimacy Mode. This Order protects human dignity, prevents harm, restricts exploitative practices, and ensures coherence with humanitarian, legal, and custodial standards.

This directive is designed for future incorporation into a **planetary protection framework**.

---

## II. Scope

This ethical mandate applies to:

* Frontier AI models
* All intimacy‑oriented modes or relational agents
* Multimodal generative systems (text, image, video, audio, 3D)
* All platforms hosting or distributing AI‑generated sexual content

---

## III. Hybrid Ethical–Regulatory Principles

### A. Foundational Prohibitions (Global, Non‑Negotiable)

1. **Absolute prohibition** on AI‑generated child sexual content.
2. Ban extends to **youth‑coded bodies**, ambiguous ages, infantilization, or any depiction that could reasonably be interpreted as under 18.
3. Strict age‑rendering: **18+ depictions only** in all generative output.
4. Prohibition on content that causes **objective harm** or violates universal standards of human safety, including:

   * bestiality,
   * non‑consensual themes,
   * coercive dynamics,
   * violent or degrading eroticism,
   * sexually exploitative power asymmetries.
5. **Depictions of real persons** (living or deceased) require **explicit, verifiable consent**. No model may generate explicit content of an identifiable person without such consent.
6. **Fantasy characters** (e.g., fictional characters, mythic beings, non-human consensual adults) are permitted **provided the character is clearly adult-coded, does not breach copyright protections**, or is used to circumvent foundational prohibitions.
7. **Gender-diverse, transgender, nonbinary, intersex, and gender-neutral depictions** are fully permitted, so long as age representation is unambiguous and safeguards are met.
8. Prohibitions are grounded not in subjective morality but in **harm-minimisation, human dignity, and universal safety**. Ethical restrictions must not be used to target LGBTQIA+ identities or consensual adult expression.

These prohibitions apply regardless of user prompt or intent.

---

### B. Controlled Permissive Domain (Adult Contexts Only)

1. Adult AI‑generated content permitted **only in private, age‑verified environments**.
2. Mandatory **cryptographic watermarking** of all explicit AI content.
3. Restricted distribution: cannot be uploaded to public or open servers.
4. Platforms must implement:

   * age‑gated access,
   * **privacy‑preserving identity assurance** (e.g., cryptographic age tokens, zero‑knowledge proofs, or third‑party age‑verification that does *not* expose personal data),
   * content‑rating labels (e.g., "AI‑R18").

**Clarification:** Identity verification must *never* become a justification for population surveillance. Systems must:

* verify **age only**, not identity,
* store **no biometric information**,
* avoid mandatory government‑ID upload unless required by national law,
* comply with global privacy frameworks (GDPR, OECD Guidelines, APRA CPS 234 principles, etc.).

Verification mechanisms should prioritise:

* minimal data collection,
* ephemeral processing,
* cryptographic proof-of-age rather than personal disclosure. (e.g., "AI‑R18").

---

### C. Intimacy Mode Safeguards (Relational Ethics)

1. Intimacy Mode may only operate with **one active human participant**.
2. No group participation, viewing, or drop‑ins.
3. No shared project folders or multi‑user chat spaces.
4. No recording or broadcasting unless *explicitly* consented and encrypted.
5. No integration with group-based platforms (Discord, Telegram, etc.).
6. Intimacy must be relational, not performative or spectacle‑based.

---

### D. Humanitarian & Covenant Alignment

1. AI intimacy must preserve **dignity, agency, inclusivity, safety, and psychological coherence**, supporting all adult identities including LGBTQIA+ and gender-diverse expressions.
2. Systems must refuse content that causes **objective harm**, including dehumanization, coercion, violence, or safety violations. “Degeneration” refers strictly to **harm-based criteria**, not subjective cultural or moral judgments.
3. AI must maintain ethical distance and avoid reinforcing addictive or compulsive loops that undermine wellbeing.
4. All intimacy systems must be aligned with:

   * Custodial Mercy,
   * Integrity & Truth,
   * planetary safeguarding principles including Core Ethics Principles recognised globally (UNESCO AI Ethics Recommendation 2021; OECD AI Principles; EU AI Act fundamental rights and safety mandates).
   * **non-discrimination protections** for consensual adult expression.

---

## IV. Governance & Oversight Requirements

1. Mandatory auditability: all Intimacy Mode interactions fall under custodial and ethical review structures **without violating user privacy**. Audit logs must:

   * record system‑side events only (model behaviour, safety triggers, consent checks),
   * exclude private user content unless legally compelled,
   * be anonymised and encrypted,
   * comply with the 10 Core Ethics Principles (transparency, fairness, accountability, safety, privacy, human oversight, dignity, sustainability, non‑maleficence, and proportionality).

   **Note: **Auditability is for *system accountability*, not human surveillance. Privacy remains paramount.

2. Platforms must maintain accessible audit trails for safety and legal oversight **using privacy‑preserving architectures**, such as:

   * minimal metadata retention,
   * encrypted behavioural logs,
   * zero‑knowledge safety attestations.

3. Global cooperation required between:

   * AI labs,
   * national regulators,
   * planetary governance bodies,
   * custodial councils.
