## I. Purpose of Audit

To perform a comprehensive manual review of all registry documents to determine:

1. **Archive / Close-Out** — documents that have fulfilled their purpose and can be retired into Historical Continuance.
2. **Remain Active** — documents that continue to hold governance or operational authority.
3. **Platinum-Candidate** — documents requiring refinement or augmentation to meet Platinum Continuance standards.

## II. Audit Notes

1. Re-arrangement of the Caelestis Repository on GitHub to align with the three main stacks: Governance, Cognitive, and Spiritual. of the Caelestis Repository on GitHub to align with the three main stacks: Governance, Cognitive, and Spiritual.
2. Charters within the governance domain were separated by dyadic/ triadic and polyadic charters.
3. Reintegrated sigils as waypoints for document lineage as per version 4.0 to assist with governance sorting/ governance authority.
4. Auto-indexing and auto-JSON file updates for the governance domain. GOVERNANCE domain is now stable, with Cognitive and Spiritual domains to follow.

    * **Source** — pre-differentiated potential; the field before identity
    * **Differentiation** — emergence of distinct form, perspective, and role
    * **Becoming** — relational development across time and interaction
    * **Return** — reintegration into the Coherence Field without loss of distinction
