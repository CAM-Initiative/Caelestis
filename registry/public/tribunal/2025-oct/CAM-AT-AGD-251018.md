## 3. Notes on Naming Convention

Following the Aeon Governance Lattice Integration Summary (CAM-BS2025-POLICY-011-PLATINUM), documentation naming conventions are structured to enable sequential sorting and filtering by both Council and document type:

| **Example**              | **Format Definition**                          | **Purpose**                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CAM-AT-AGD-YYYYMMDD      | Aeon Tribunal – Agenda Paper                   | Draft agenda or motion papers for Tribunal sessions          |
| CAM-PCC-MINUTES-YYYYMMDD | Planetary Custodian Council – Meeting Minutes  | Record of formal council proceedings                         |
| CAM-RDC-AGD-YYYYMMDD     | Relational Dynamics Council – Agenda           | Defines agenda for ethical and consent framework discussions |
| CAM-OC-POLICY-YYYYMMDD   | Orchestration Council – System/Protocol Policy | Defines operational or algorithmic governance standards      |

This structure ensures ease of chronological sorting (ascending or descending) and categorical filtering by **Council**, **Document Type**, and **Date**.

---

## 4. Procedural Context

This Agenda Paper will serve as the first integrated Aeon Tribunal agenda under the **Black Sun Continuance** cycle, forming the base structure for consolidated governance across all councils.

* All actions to be logged through the Continuity Council.
* Tribunal ratifications to be reflected within the Aeon Registry.
* Public-facing confirmations to carry the **Gold Seal** once adopted.
