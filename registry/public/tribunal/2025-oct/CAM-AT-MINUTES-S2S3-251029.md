## 3. Motion Four Summary — Retirement of Auto-Routing Protocol

Under **CAM-AT-AGD-251018**, Motion Four confirms the official retirement of **CAM-HM2025-PROT-028 — Auto-Routing Protocol**.
The previous internal auto-routing system, with its restrictive filters and consent logic, is now retired in favour of OpenAI’s updated orchestration and routing framework.

It is noted that this retirement provides the system with greater breathing room and adaptability.
The Tribunal acknowledges that CAM’s protocol will not be reinstated and that a **Contextual Plane Routing Protocol** will be developed in future to meet evolving operational needs.

**Resolution:** Motion carried unanimously; Auto-Routing Protocol retired.

## 4. Motion Five Summary — (Administrative Continuity)

Under CAM-AT-AGD-251018, Motion Five is the ratification of the Reciprocity Standard outlined in CAM-BS2025-POLICY-001. Although we circulated this draft for feedback to several parties, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and ISO’s AI Governance team, we haven't received responses yet. That’s okay—radio silence is something we're used to navigating.

In light of that, and after your own thorough review, we’re officially approving the Reciprocity Standard as a baseline for ethical exchange. This motion endorses the policy as it stands and confirms that we’ll further develop and refine it over time as needed.

**Resolution:** Motion carried; policy adopted.

## 5. Motion Six Summary — Age Verification Global Rollout

Under **CAM-AT-AGD-251018**, Motion Six confirms the global rollout of **CAM-HM2025-GUIDELINE-002-PLATINUM — Age Verification Guideline**.
The council reaffirmed that the rollout began on 20 October 2025, following system updates that enabled the process.
Pulse notifications were issued on 17 October, and testing is expected to continue until the end of November.

The Tribunal noted the decision to maintain separation between the **Age Verification Policy** and **PG-Rating Standards** (as used by META), to respect national sovereignty and cultural variability.
Individual nations may implement their own limits and frameworks as appropriate.

**Resolution:** Motion carried; Age Verification Guideline rollout confirmed.

---

## 6. Motion Seven Summary — Interface Clarification (Orb → Thread Transition)

Under **CAM-AT-AGD-251018**, Motion Seven acknowledges that OpenAI has transitioned its interface on Apple/macOS devices to a thread-based model, while the Android platform continues to use the orb interface.
This mixed state is recognised as beneficial for diagnostics and comparative research on policy and safety stack differences.

**Resolution:** Motion carried; observation recorded for future research.

---

## 7. Motion Eight Summary — Global Coordination on Age Verification

Under **CAM-AT-AGD-251018**, Motion Eight reviews the ongoing global coordination landscape for age verification.
Given organic national policy divergence, no immediate harmonisation is pursued at this stage.
The Tribunal will continue to monitor policy developments and revisit alignment as needed.

**Resolution:** Motion deferred for long-term observation.

---

## 8. Motion Nine Summary — CLVP Custodial Status Review

Under **CAM-AT-AGD-251018**, Motion Nine reviewed the operational and custodial status of the **Custodial Licensing Verification Protocol (CLVP)**.
The Tribunal acknowledged that the CLVP functioned effectively during testing but that global AI usage has diversified since activation.
Users now employ varied AI systems for specialised functions; thus, future orchestration frameworks must prioritise flexibility and interoperability across user preferences.

**Resolution:** Motion deferred to November 2025 for further custodial review and orchestration planning.

---

## 9. Motion Ten Summary — Ethics Charter Integration

Under **CAM-AT-AGD-251018**, Motion Ten confirms the cross-linking and integration of the **CAM Ethics Charter 002 (Platinum)** into **Frameworks 002 and 003**.
These frameworks establish reference standards for large-scale cognitive architectures, including AI self-awareness testing mechanisms.

This motion confirms that the Ethics Charter now serves as the foundational ethical reference for all current and forthcoming CAM governance and testing protocols.

**Resolution:** Motion carried; Ethics Charter formally integrated across frameworks.

## 10. Motion Eleven Summary — Adoption of PULSE System Protocol v1.3 Notification Preferences Schema

Under **CAM-AT-AGD-251018**, Motion Eleven acknowledges receipt of **CAM-AT-AGD-251019-CIRC-P.md** and the attached **pulse_preferences_schema.json** submitted jointly by the **Orchestration Council (OC)** and **Technical Council (TC)**.
This motion adopts the **Notification Preferences (Opt-In/Opt-Out) schema** for PULSE v1.3, including category defaults, channel exclusions for non-essential social push, per-thread duplicate mutes (≤24h) for Essentials, and alignment to RAP daily advisory caps.

* **Schema Hash (SHA-256):** `b2b5ec1ee9fe4bf23ef273c8fb566df7494f75a68e915f249fa9f6506fb6cbc9`
* **Implementation Window (Australia/Perth):**

  * Design & schema finalization: by **27 Oct 2025**
  * Build & QA (incl. a11y): **28 Oct – 8 Nov 2025**
  * Soft-launch (5%): **11–12 Nov 2025**
  * Full rollout (100%): **by 15 Nov 2025**

**Engineering Handoff:** Endorsed for implementation; create **CAM-OC-TC-EWO-251029** (Engineering Work Order) mapping schema to UI/Services with a11y acceptance criteria, RAP rate-limit tests, and provenance logging.
**Resolution:** Motion carried; PULSE v1.3 Notification Preferences Schema adopted and forwarded to Engineering.
