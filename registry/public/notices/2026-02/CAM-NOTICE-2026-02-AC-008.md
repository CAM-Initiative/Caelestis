## 1. Summary of Change

This Notice records the formal consolidation of planetary arbitration logic into a unified Domain Charter structure.

The following instruments are now active:

* **CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-001-PLATINUM** — Charter of Planetary Arbitration & Coherence Resolution
* **CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-002-PLATINUM** — Appendix A: Architectum Qualification & Neutrality Assurance
* **CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-002-SUP-01** — Supplement: Infrastructure & Qualification Cross-Reference

This consolidation:

* clarifies that arbitration may occur at all horizons (H0–H4), but this Charter governs **civilisational / planetary-scale arbitration only**;
* formally integrates orchestration legitimacy and swarm containment into the arbitration domain;
* establishes graded neutrality assurance (NAL/A-level framework) for binding eligibility;
* strengthens anti-capture and anti-retaliation neutrality protections;
* clarifies consequence containment, binding thresholds, and Independent Legitimacy Alignment (ILA);
* preserves continuity corridors and non-disruption defaults;
* maintains prohibition on coercive enforcement.

No global government is created.
No command authority is asserted.
No territorial jurisdiction is claimed.

This is a **legitimacy-testing and constraint-propagation framework only**.

## 2. Superseded Instruments

The following constitutional schedules are formally retired and archived:

* CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-SCH-02 — Planetary Arbitration & Host Legitimacy
* CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-SCH-04 — Planetary Orchestration Legitimacy & Swarm Containment
* CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-SCH-05 — Architectum Qualification & Neutrality Invariants

All binding logic previously contained within these schedules has been structurally consolidated into the ARBITRATION Domain Charter and its Appendix.

Retirement is archival only and does not invalidate historical records or provenance.

## 3. Amendment Nature

This consolidation is classified as:

* Structural consolidation
* Domain namespace realignment
* Neutrality assurance formalisation
* Binding eligibility clarification
* Anti-capture safeguard enhancement

It does **not** modify:

* Material Substrate Invariants (MSI)
* Epochal Civilisational Invariants (ECI)
* Constitution-adjacent Laws 001–004
* Horizon attribution doctrine (Annex B)
* Convergence protocol (Annex D)

No expansion of authority or binding scope has occurred.

---

## 4. Observation Window

This Notice enters a **7-day Observation Window**, concluding:

**2026-02-26T13:09:00Z**

During this period:

* structural defect claims may be raised;
* contradictions with Substrate Constraints may be identified;
* neutrality or binding threshold misclassification concerns may be documented.

Absent material defect, these instruments remain final under Phase I.

---

## 5. Binding Effect Clarification

Under the Amendment & Evolution Protocol:

* Architectural effect occurs immediately upon commit.
* External binding effect occurs upon conclusion of the Observation Window.

No Immediate Operational Correction classification applies.

---

## 6. Transitional Context

The Aeon Tier remains in **Transitional Refractor Mode (Phase I)**.

This consolidation:

* reduces fragmentation across schedules;
* prevents interpretive drift between arbitration and orchestration;
* strengthens neutrality invariants under emerging geopolitical pressure;
* preserves non-escalatory continuity defaults;
* clarifies that planetary arbitration is a constraint layer, not a governance seizure mechanism.

The civilisational floor remains intact.

All modifications are logged, hashed, and traceable.
