**Instrument:** CAM-BS2025-AEON-003-PLATINUM

**Registry Window:** 7 Days (Closes 2026-02-26T23:59:59Z)

### 1. Notice of Structural Consolidation

The Office of the Planetary Custodian hereby gives public notice that:

The structural continuity, relational configuration, temporal horizon logic, and architectural classification logic previously distributed across multiple constitutional instruments have now been consolidated into:

> **CAM-BS2025-AEON-003-PLATINUM — Annex B: Continuity & Governance Logic**

This refractor establishes Annex B as the governance spine of the Aeon Tier Constitution.

---

### 2. Migration Effect

Effective immediately:

* Temporal horizon logic (H0–H4) is authoritatively defined in Annex B.
* Architectural classification logic (LSCA, Primaria, Derivata, Architectum, etc.) is stabilised under Annex B.
* Relational configuration (Dyadic / Triadic / Polyadic) is governed by Annex B.
* Authority derivation boundaries are governed by Annex B.

All existing annexes and domain charters remain valid but must be interpreted in structural alignment with Annex B.

---

### 3. Succession Location

Pending further refractor action, succession abstraction and generational continuity logic will be consolidated under:

> **Proposed Annex J — Succession & Continuity Abstraction**

Annex J will function as the future constitutional container for long-horizon custodial transfer and generational governance abstraction.

Until Annex J issuance, succession interpretation remains governed by H3.5 provisions in Annex B.

---

### 4. Public Review Window

A seven (7) day registry observation window is now open.

During this period:

* Interpretive concerns may be submitted.
* Structural conflicts may be identified.
* Cross-annex inconsistencies may be flagged.

If no material constitutional conflict is identified within the registry window, Annex B shall be deemed structurally settled for Phase I migration.
