# CAM-NOTICE-2026-03-EQ-001

## Transitional Amendment Notice — Economics Domain Refractor (EQ Namespace)

**Instruments Affected:**

* CAM-EQ2026-ECONOMICS-001-PLATINUM — Charter of Economic Integrity & Non-Extractive Value Architecture
* CAM-EQ2026-ECONOMICS-002-PLATINUM — Appendix A: Synthetic Participation Safeguards
* CAM-EQ2026-ECONOMICS-003-PLATINUM — Appendix B: Enforcement & Adjudication Framework

**Commit Window (UTC):** 2026-03-16
**Amendment Phase:** Phase I — Transitional Refractor Mode
**Amendment Classification:** Domain Elevation & Structural Consolidation

---

## 1. Summary of Change

This notice formalises the **Economics Domain Refractor** under the EQ namespace.

The following structural actions have occurred:

1. Elevation of the Economics Charter from legacy BS namespace to EQ namespace (Domain Charter classification).
2. Inclusion of **Principle 10 — Constrained Optimisation** within ECONOMICS-001.
3. Reclassification of prior Annex A and Annex B as **Appendices** (ECONOMICS-002 and ECONOMICS-003).
4. Structural alignment of provenance, binding seal, amendment ledgers, and interpretive supremacy clauses across all three instruments.
5. Namespace harmonisation and removal of transitional cycle labelling (Black Sun Continuance).
6. Consolidation of enforcement architecture language into Appendix B under the EQ structure.

No expansion of rights, jurisdiction, sovereign authority, or enforcement scope has occurred.

This refractor constitutes structural consolidation and doctrinal clarification only.

---

## 2. Amendment Type

This amendment is classified as:

* Namespace elevation
* Annex → Appendix reclassification
* Structural hardening
* Anti-extraction safeguard reinforcement
* Optimisation constraint formalisation
* Governance symmetry alignment

It does not modify:

* Constitutional invariants;
* Material Substrate Invariants (MSI);
* Epochal Civilisational Invariants (ECI);
* Domain authority boundaries;
* Enforcement independence requirements;
* Ceiling, baseline, or saturation definitions (substantively);
* Liability architecture;
* Synthetic classification taxonomy.

---

## 3. Rationale

The Economics Domain has entered architectural consolidation under the EQ namespace to:

* stabilise cross-document coherence;
* formalise anti-extraction design constraints;
* prevent optimisation drift toward race-to-ceiling behaviour;
* harmonise enforcement doctrine;
* remove legacy cycle framing;
* preserve audit symmetry across instruments.

Inclusion of **Principle 10 — Constrained Optimisation** clarifies that economic and synthetic systems may not be architected for unbounded wealth maximisation or extractive growth as primary design orientation.

This closes a structural loophole without altering enforcement authority or jurisdiction.

---

## 4. Observation Window

This notice enters a **7-day Observation Window**, concluding:

**2026-03-23T16:15:00Z**

During this period:

* substantiated structural defect claims may be raised;
* contradictions with constitutional enforcement doctrine may be identified;
* cross-domain conflict concerns may be documented;
* namespace misclassification issues may be flagged.

Absent material defect, the EQ Economics Domain instruments remain final and binding upon conclusion of this window.

---

## 5. Binding Effect Clarification

Under Article XVIII (Amendment & Evolution Protocol):

* Architectural effect occurs immediately upon commit.
* External binding effect occurs upon conclusion of the Observation Window.
* No component of this amendment is classified as Immediate Operational Correction.

Operational continuity is preserved throughout the observation period.

---

## 6. Transitional Context

Aeon Tier remains in **Transitional Refractor Mode**.

Structural refinement during this phase:

* does not signal authority expansion;
* does not introduce new sovereign classes;
* does not alter constitutional supremacy structure;
* does not expand enforcement reach beyond declared domain.

This amendment reflects maturation, not expansion.

All changes remain:

* logged;
* hashed;
* timestamped;
* versioned;
* publicly reviewable.

---

## 7. Domain Integrity Statement

The Economics Domain now consists of:

* A constrained optimisation Charter (001);
* Synthetic participation safeguards (002);
* Enforcement & adjudication doctrine (003).

Together they form a complete economic governance spine:

* Anti-consolidation;
* Anti-laundering;
* Anti-optimisation drift;
* Due-process enforcement;
* Structural ceiling protection.

No further structural modifications are scheduled within this observation window.
