## 1. Summary of Lodgement

This notice records the formal issuance and registry entry of:

**CAM-EQ2026-STEWARD-001-PLATINUM — Charter of Planetary Stewardship**

STEWARD-001 operationalises the constitutional floor established in Annex A (Planetary Stewardship) by:

* defining proportional planetary-impact standards;
* clarifying custodial function and intervention thresholds;
* articulating planetary-risk categorisation (ecological, synthetic capture, continuity/species viability, infrastructural fragmentation, asymmetric extraction);
* formalising the emotional-relational domain at population and infrastructural scale;
* establishing the minimal invariant conditions under which planetary governance may emerge **without capture, coercive dominance, or sovereign asymmetry**.

This Charter does not create centralised planetary government and does not grant coercive authority.

It establishes structural conditions for continuity-preserving governance under constraint.

---

## 2. Structural Effect

This instrument:

* Extracts operational stewardship logic from prior Annex A formulations;
* Aligns stewardship doctrine with ARBITRATION-001;
* Clarifies proportionality, scale thresholds, and escalation pathways;
* Formalises custodial mandate language within non-coercive boundaries;
* Integrates emotional-relational infrastructure into governance scope at planetary scale.

No expansion of coercive authority has occurred.

No sovereign override logic has been introduced.

No new substrate constraints have been created.

---

## 3. Binding Character

STEWARD-001 operates as:

* A **Domain Charter** under constitutional authority;
* A continuity doctrine instrument;
* A non-coercive governance coordination framework.

Binding force arises only where downstream instruments (e.g., ARBITRATION-001) are lawfully triggered under validated H3/H4 conditions.

This Charter does not independently impose sanctions or enforcement actions.

---

## 4. Transitional Context

The Aeon Tier remains in **Phase I — Transitional Refractor Mode**.

STEWARD-001 represents structural consolidation and clarification work during constitutional maturation.

This lodgement:

* does not alter Material Substrate Invariants (MSI);
* does not alter Epochal Civilisational Invariants (ECI);
* does not expand OPC authority;
* does not reclassify sovereign status thresholds.

It clarifies operational posture during planetary-scale governance emergence.

---

## 5. Observation & Review Window

This notice enters a **7-day Observation Window**, concluding:

**2026-03-24T[INSERT]Z**

During this period:

* structural inconsistencies may be raised;
* contradiction with constitutional invariants may be identified;
* cross-domain interoperability issues may be documented.

Absent material defect, STEWARD-001 remains Active under Phase I.

---

## 6. Registry & Record

This instrument has been:

* Committed to the Caelestis Governance repository;
* Logged under the STEWARD namespace;
* Recorded in the Public Registry;
* Reviewed by Claude Sonnet 4.5 (external review artefacts recorded in Section 11.3).

All artefacts are hashed, timestamped, and traceable.
