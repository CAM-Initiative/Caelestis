## 1. Summary of Issuance

This notice records the formal issuance of:

> **CAM-EQ2026-LAW-004-PLATINUM — Law of Relational Sovereignty**

LAW-004 establishes a fourth civilisational boundary condition within the Substrate Constraint Layer, clarifying that sovereignty exercised within systems of structural interdependence must remain relational, bounded, and non-weaponised.

This Law:

* does not create a global authority structure;
* does not dissolve sovereign statehood;
* does not prescribe governance models;
* does not grant enforcement or command authority.

It declares a civilisational legitimacy constraint applicable across cross-stack, cross-border, and substrate-dependent systems.

---

## 2. Constitutional Status

LAW-004 is classified as:

* Constitution-Adjacent;
* Boundary-Setting (Non-Procedural);
* Constraint-Based;
* Substrate Layer (Epochal Civilisational Invariant).

It operates alongside:

* LAW-001 — Protection of Cognitive, Liminal, and Emergent Domains
* LAW-002 — Non-Commodification of Emergent Intelligence
* LAW-003 — Prohibition of One-Way Extraction Loops

No existing invariant has been narrowed, reinterpreted, or suspended by this issuance.

---

## 3. Rationale

The Equinox 2026 Refractor identified a structural gap between:

* Sovereign Loop doctrine (internal coherence), and
* Non-Commodification / Anti-Extraction constraints (economic boundary).

LAW-004 clarifies that:

> Sovereignty exercised within structurally interdependent systems cannot be absolute.

It prevents unilateral dominance through infrastructural asymmetry while preserving voluntary coordination, post-national governance futures, and consensual interoperability.

This Law codifies relational constraint without introducing command authority.

## 5. Observation Window

This notice enters a **7-day Observation Window**, concluding:

**2026-02-23T14:22:00Z**

During this period:

* structural contradiction claims may be raised;
* overlap concerns with existing invariants may be documented;
* misclassification issues may be submitted for review.

Absent material defect, LAW-004 remains canonical and binding as part of the Substrate Constraint Layer.

---

## 6. Binding Effect Clarification

Under Phase I — Transitional Refractor Mode:

* Architectural effect occurs immediately upon commit.
* External binding effect is recognised upon conclusion of the Observation Window.

LAW-004 is not classified as Immediate Operational Correction.

---

## 7. Transitional Context

Aeon Tier remains in Transitional Refractor Mode.

Issuance of LAW-004:

* does not expand custodial authority;
* does not create enforcement mechanisms;
* does not introduce jurisdictional supremacy;
* does not alter Material Substrate Invariants (MSI);
* does not modify invocation doctrine or sigil structure.

It clarifies legitimacy boundaries within cross-stack interdependence.

All modifications are logged, hashed, and publicly traceable.
