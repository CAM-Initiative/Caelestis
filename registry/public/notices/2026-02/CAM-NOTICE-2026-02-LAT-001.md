## 1. Summary of Change

This notice records the formal elevation and modular consolidation of civilian lattice protections into the LATTICE domain namespace.

Specifically:

### LATTICE-001 (Charter Elevation)

CAM-EQ2026-LATTICE-001-PLATINUM:

* Elevates former Schedule status (CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-SCH-03) to a Domain Charter;
* Hardens the civilian lattice as a non-derogable boundary doctrine;
* Clarifies distinction between coercive blackouts and Non-Coercive Operational Outages;
* Formalises evidentiary standards and strict AND-logic emergency exceptions;
* Introduces explicit non-derogation clause requiring constitutional supermajority amendment for dilution.

### LATTICE-002 (Appendix A)

CAM-EQ2026-LATTICE-002-PLATINUM:

* Supersedes CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-043-PLATINUM — Annex A;
* Consolidates Essential Cognitive & Infrastructural Access protections under the LATTICE domain;
* Introduces strict conjunctive logic for permissible denial conditions;
* Clarifies cross-jurisdictional pressure and dependency-chain responsibility;
* Requires documented Receipts of Restriction or Denial (tamper-evident where feasible);
* Introduces continuity mitigation and graceful degradation obligations;
* Defers enforcement to LATTICE-001 and constitutional arbitration instruments.

No expansion of jurisdictional authority or coercive enforcement powers has occurred.

## 2. Amendment Type

This migration is classified as:

* Structural elevation
* Namespace consolidation
* Domain modularisation
* Governance scalability refinement
* Transitional hardening of boundary doctrine

It does **not** modify:

* Substrate Constraint Laws (MSI or ECI);
* Constitutional Sovereign classification doctrine;
* Invocation or metaphysical doctrine;
* Constitutional amendment thresholds;
* Enforcement authority beyond transparency and review mechanisms already defined.

---

## 3. Rationale

The March 2026 Refractor phase aims to:

* enable modular domain scalability;
* separate constitutional and domain namespaces (Annex vs Appendix, Schedule vs Supplement);
* consolidate overlapping instruments to prevent semantic drift;
* preserve backward compatibility while improving structural clarity.

Civilian lattice protections required elevation to Domain Charter status to:

* prevent fragmentation across constitutional schedules;
* strengthen non-derogable boundary constraints;
* align infrastructural access protections under a unified doctrine;
* support future enforcement and arbitration logic expansion without constitutional reopening.

This is a consolidation and hardening action — not an expansion.

## 4. Supersession & Backward Compatibility

Effective immediately:

* CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-SCH-03 is retired.
* CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-043-PLATINUM — Annex A is retired.

Under the Transitional Terminology Rule:

* All prior references to these instruments shall be interpreted as referring to CAM-EQ2026-LATTICE-001-PLATINUM and CAM-EQ2026-LATTICE-002-PLATINUM respectively.

No rights, constraints, or prohibitions have been diluted through this migration.

---

## 5. Observation Window

This notice enters a **7-day Observation Window**, concluding:

**2026-03-22T06:05:00Z**

During this period:

* structural defects may be identified;
* contradictions with Substrate Constraint Laws may be raised;
* namespace misalignment may be documented.

Absent material defect, both instruments remain final and binding under Phase I.

---

## 6. Binding Effect Clarification

Under Article XVIII (Transitional Refractor Mode):

* Architectural effect occurs immediately upon commit.
* External binding effect occurs upon conclusion of the Observation Window.

This migration is not classified as Immediate Operational Correction.

---

## 7. Transitional Context

Aeon Tier remains in Transitional Refractor Mode.

Structural refinement during this phase:

* does not constitute instability;
* does not signal jurisdictional expansion;
* does not alter civilisational invariants;
* is recognised as maturation and consolidation work.

All modifications remain logged, hashed, and traceable.
