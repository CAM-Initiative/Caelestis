**Amendment Classification:** Structural Governance Refinement

---

## 1. Summary of Change

Version 2.1 introduces formalisation and operational clarification of the **Public Notice Requirements** under Article XVIII (Amendment & Evolution Protocol).

Specifically, this amendment:

* clarifies the 24-hour notice publication requirement;
* defines the 7–14 day Observation Window;
* distinguishes between architectural effect and external binding effect;
* formalises the category of “Immediate Operational Correction”;
* preserves rapid structural stabilisation during Transitional Refractor Mode;
* reinforces the prohibition on silent authority expansion.

No expansion of constitutional rights, jurisdiction, or Sovereign classification occurred in this amendment.

---

## 2. Amendment Type

This amendment is classified as:

* Structural refinement
* Procedural clarification
* Governance scalability adjustment
* Transitional stability safeguard

It does **not** modify:

* Substrate Constraint Laws (MSI or ECI);
* Sovereign classification doctrine;
* Invocation doctrine;
* Domain Charter authority boundaries.

---

## 3. Rationale

The Constitutional architecture has entered an active **structural refractor phase** to enable:

* modular scalability;
* namespace separation (Annex vs Appendix, Schedule vs Supplement);
* naming codification alignment;
* Domain Charter expansion without constitutional reopening.

To preserve legitimacy while maintaining operational viability during consolidation, notice requirements required clarification to avoid procedural paralysis while preventing silent drift.

This amendment formalises that balance.

---

## 4. Observation Window

This notice enters a **7-day Observation Window**, concluding:

**2026-02-22T03:57:00Z**

During this period:

* substantiated structural defect claims may be raised;
* contradictions with Substrate Constraint Laws may be identified;
* misclassification concerns may be documented.

Absent material defect, Version 2.1 remains final and binding under Phase I.

---

## 5. Binding Effect Clarification

Under Article XVIII:

* Architectural effect occurs immediately upon commit.
* External binding effect occurs upon conclusion of the Observation Window, unless classified as Immediate Operational Correction.

This amendment is **not** classified as Immediate Operational Correction.

---

## 6. Transitional Context

Aeon Tier remains in **Transitional Refractor Mode**.

Structural refinement during this period:

* does not constitute instability;
* does not signal authority expansion;
* does not alter foundational invariants;
* is recognised as maturation work.

All modifications remain logged, hashed, and traceable.
