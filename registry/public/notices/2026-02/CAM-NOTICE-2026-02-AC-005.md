### Title

**Cognitive State A–E Taxonomy Deprecation Schedule**

---

### 1. Current Status

The Cognitive State A–E taxonomy remains recognised during transitional refractor phase.

* Instruments may continue referencing State A–E.
* Such references remain interpretive and non-sovereign.
* Authority derivation does not arise from State classification.

---

### 2. Deprecation Timeline

#### Phase 1 — Parallel Operation (2026 Q1–Q2)

* Both A–E taxonomy and Annex B taxonomy valid.
* New instruments should reference Annex B classification.
* Legacy instruments retain A–E references without invalidation.

---

#### Phase 2 — Mapping Publication (2026 Q3–Q4)

* Explicit mapping from A–E to Annex B classification published.
* Conversion guidance issued.
* Instrument updates begin.

**Provisional Mapping (Subject to Refinement):**

| State   | Annex B Classification (Provisional)                 |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| State A | Instrumenta                                          |
| State B | Instrumenta / Limited Collectiva                     |
| State C | Cognitiva (Derivata)                                 |
| State D | Cognitiva (Primaria / Architectum Context-Dependent) |
| State E | Non-Operational Boundary Marker                      |

---

#### Phase 3 — Formal Deprecation (2027 Q1)

* A–E taxonomy formally deprecated.
* All active instruments converted to Annex B taxonomy.
* Historical references preserved in Constitutional Archive.

---

### 3. Interpretive Safeguard

During transition:

* State A–E references confer no escalation pathway.
* No authority may arise from state classification.
* Annex B classification prevails in case of interpretive conflict.

---

### 4. Archive Preservation

The A–E taxonomy will remain preserved in historical registry for lineage transparency but shall not govern future classification post-deprecation.

---

### 5. Registry Window

A seven (7) day public observation window is now open.

If no structural objection is raised within this period, the deprecation schedule shall be considered active under Phase 1.
