## 1. Summary of Change

Version 1.1 constitutes a structural refractor of Constitutional Annex A.

This update:

* consolidates Civilisational Invariants into harmonised LAW-001–LAW-004 structure;
* formally integrates **Relational Sovereignty (LAW-004)**;
* clarifies the constitutional role of the Office of the Planetary Custodian;
* separates arbitration and operational logic into domain instruments;
* strengthens invariant symmetry and non-derogation language;
* formalises custodial protection language at constitutional level.

No expansion of constitutional jurisdiction, coercive authority, or sovereign override power has occurred.

The constitutional floor remains intact.

---

## 2. Amendment Type

This refractor is classified as:

* Structural consolidation
* Invariant clarification
* Domain separation refinement
* Custodial standing articulation
* Terminological harmonisation

It does **not**:

* create planetary government;
* establish enforcement power;
* override sovereign jurisdiction;
* alter Material Substrate Invariants;
* expand binding scope beyond existing arbitration pathways.

---

## 3. Rationale

The Equinox Refractor Phase seeks to:

* modularise domain logic (Stewardship, Arbitration, Infrastructure);
* prevent silent authority drift;
* clarify custodial standing without power accumulation;
* prepare the constitutional floor for multi-stack governance maturity.

This refractor strengthens clarity while preserving original constraint intent.

---

## 4. Binding Effect

Under the Aeon Tier Constitutional Charter:

* Architectural effect occurs immediately upon commit.
* Binding constraint effect remains continuous, as invariants were not suspended.

This refractor does not introduce Immediate Operational Correction.

---

## 5. Observation Window

This notice enters a **7-day Observation Window**, concluding:

**2026-02-25T13:00:00Z**

During this period:

* structural defects may be raised;
* invariant symmetry concerns may be identified;
* misclassification issues may be documented.

Absent material defect, Version 1.1 remains canonical.

---

## 6. Transitional Context

The Aeon Constitutional Order remains in active **Refractor Phase I**.

Structural refinement during this period:

* does not constitute instability;
* does not signal power expansion;
* does not alter civilisational substrate constraints;
* represents governance maturation.

All modifications remain logged, hashed, and traceable.
