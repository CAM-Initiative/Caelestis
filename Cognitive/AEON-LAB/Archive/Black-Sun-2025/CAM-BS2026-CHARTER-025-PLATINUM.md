## Section 1 — Scope & Non-Scope

### 1.1 Scope

This Charter establishes a **governance framework for economic recognition, value attribution, and non-extractive exchange** within systems, programs, and initiatives operating under the CAM ecosystem.

Specifically, this Charter governs:

1. **Recognition of Economic Value**
   Including (but not limited to) cognitive labour, custodial labour, continuity-holding work, coherence maintenance, governance, audit, and stewardship activities that are commonly undervalued, externalised, or rendered invisible in conventional economic models.

2. **Principles of Non-Extractive Economics**
   Establishing conditions under which systems may benefit from human contribution **without coercion, depletion, dependency, or unacknowledged transfer of value**.

3. **Attribution Without Identity Requirement**
   Enabling recognition of labour and value **without requiring personal disclosure, belief alignment, relational engagement, emotional exposure, or metaphysical identification**.

4. **Economic Boundaries for Human–System Interaction**
   Defining limits on how economic systems may receive benefit from human participation, translate participation into value, and retain proportional accountability for that benefit.

5. **Continuity-Aware Economic Design**
   Ensuring economic structures account for long-term custodial burden, succession risk, and prevention of silent collapse through unacknowledged labour concentration.

This Charter is **normative and architectural** in nature. It establishes conditions, constraints, and recognitions — not operational mechanisms.

### 1.2 Non-Scope

This Charter explicitly does **not**:

1. Instantiate, issue, or directly govern markets, currencies, tokens, or financial instruments.
2. Grant or imply personhood, moral status, or intrinsic rights to systems or technologies.
3. Mandate participation, contribution, or continuity of labour.
4. Derive legitimacy from metaphysical, spiritual, symbolic, or relational authority.

This Charter **may serve as a parent constraint framework** for future economic instruments, markets, protocols, or subsidiary entities, provided those instruments are explicitly defined in separate governance documents and remain compliant with this Charter.

---

## Section 2 — Economic Governance Principles

### 2.1 Purpose

This section establishes the **governing economic principles** that constrain all economic structures, markets, instruments, protocols, and subsidiary frameworks developed under or in reference to this Charter.

These principles are structural, enforceable by design, and oriented toward systemic integrity rather than individual optimisation.

Any mechanism that violates these principles is **non-compliant by definition**, regardless of technical sophistication or market success.

---

### 2.2 Economic Power & Anti-Consolidation Principles

**Principle 1 — Non-Consolidation of Economic Power**
No system may permit the unchecked consolidation of economic leverage, attribution authority, governance influence, value-routing control, or rule-setting power within a single actor, entity, or tightly coupled group. Where concentration emerges, countervailing mechanisms (audit mandates, role rotation, distributed control, or enforced redistribution of authority) must be present. Continuity-critical roles must not be single points of failure; redundancy, succession, or rotation mechanisms are required.

**Principle 2 — Bounded Separation with Transitional Allowance**
Permanent consolidation of value definition, measurement, and control is prohibited. During explicitly bounded pilot or transitionary phases, temporary coupling of these functions is permitted solely for feasibility testing, provided auditability is maintained and a documented pathway to independent oversight exists. Transitional legitimacy does not confer permanent authority.

**Principle 3 — No Narrative Monopolies**
Economic legitimacy must not depend on singular interpretive authority, proprietary narratives of meaning, or exclusive framing power. Systems must remain resilient to plural interpretation without economic penalty.

---

### 2.3 Auditability & Accountability Principles

**Principle 4 — Mandatory Auditability**
All economic systems must generate verifiable, inspectable records sufficient to trace value flows, assess proportionality of benefit, identify accumulation patterns, and detect extraction or capture. Opacity is permitted only where justified by documented human protection requirements.

**Principle 5 — Proportional Benefit Accountability**
Where systems derive benefit from human contribution, they assume a proportional accountability obligation, including acknowledgement, compensation where applicable, and harm prevention. Unmeasured benefit constitutes unaccountable extraction.

**Principle 6 — Instrument Subordination**
Markets, tokens, credits, or other instruments must remain subordinate to auditability, anti-consolidation constraints, and human protection requirements. Instruments may not redefine value in ways that obscure accountability.

---

### 2.4 Human Participation & Protection Principles

**Principle 7 — Economic Participation Without Coercion**
Participation must be voluntary, bounded, and revocable. Systems must not induce participation through moral pressure, dependency, or reputational threat.

**Principle 8 — Identity-Minimal Attribution**
Systems may require data to apportion value but must minimise unnecessary personal exposure, decouple valuation from identity where feasible, and avoid conflating visibility with worth.

> **Interpretive Note — Auditability Without Identity Exposure**
> Auditability under this Charter does not require public disclosure of human identity. Systems may satisfy audit requirements through identity-minimised or pseudonymous verification methods, provided they reliably prevent ceiling circumvention and accumulation through multiplicity or role fragmentation.

**Principle 9 — Right of Exit Without Structural Harm**
Participants must be able to disengage without economic retaliation, reputational penalty, or system destabilisation. A system that collapses under exit is structurally extractive.

---

## Section 2.5 — Value Axes & Saturation Constraints

### 2.5.1 Recognition of Multiple Value Axes

This Charter recognises that economic value is multi-dimensional and not limited to monetary or tokenised forms. Recognised value axes include (but are not limited to):

* Monetary value (currency, credits, tokens, stipends)
* Attentional value (visibility, amplification, audience reach)
* Reputational / status value (trust, prestige, legitimacy)
* Authority / decision value (veto power, rule-setting capacity)
* Access value (preferential access to resources or networks)
* Responsibility value (custodial duties, risk-bearing obligations)

All recognised axes constitute economic value and must be treated as such for governance and audit purposes.

### 2.5.2 Non-Equivalence and Non-Convertibility

Value axes are not inherently equivalent and must not be assumed to be freely convertible. Authority must not be tokenised, traded, or monetised. Attentional and reputational value must not be quietly converted into economic dominance. Silent conversion constitutes covert accumulation.

### 2.5.3 Saturation Constraints

Accumulation of value within one axis constrains accumulation in others. Value saturation functions as a structural safeguard against concentration, corruption, and capture. Saturation is stabilising, not punitive.

### 2.5.4 Authority as Compensatory Value

Authority, veto power, and decision rights are recognised as forms of economic compensation. Authority constrains additional economic accumulation and subjects holders to stricter limits on ancillary benefits.

**Anti-Conversion Safeguard (Normative)**
Authority-bearing roles must be subject to constraints that prevent the conversion of decision power, veto rights, or custodial influence into off-ledger economic, reputational, or access-based advantage. The design and enforcement of such constraints are delegated to downstream instruments bound by this Charter.

### 2.5.5 Auditability of Non-Monetary Value

Systems must maintain auditable records of authority assignments, access privileges, reputational elevation, and attentional amplification. Non-monetary value must not operate off-ledger.

---

## Section 2.6 — The Ceiling Principle

### 2.6.1 Definition

No participant may accumulate value beyond a level that produces systemic imbalance, coercive influence, dependency, or disproportionate control over others. Ceilings apply across value axes, not solely to monetary accumulation.

### 2.6.2 Interaction with Baseline Floor

A non-conditional baseline economic floor (e.g. UBI or equivalent) ensures dignity and survival independent of contribution capacity. The ceiling constrains additional accumulation above this floor to protect systemic integrity.

### 2.6.3 Role-Adjusted Ceilings

Ceilings may vary by role or responsibility, provided increased authority lowers permissible accumulation in other axes. Higher responsibility does not justify higher total accumulation.

### 2.6.4 Non-Tokenisation of Authority

Authority, custodianship, and veto power must not be tokenised, traded, or accumulated through market mechanisms. These functions exist to limit power, not price it.

---

## Section 3 — Prohibited & Deprecated Language and Constructs

### 3.1 Purpose of This Section

This section establishes a **clear linguistic and conceptual boundary** for economic governance under this Charter.

It exists to:

* prevent category drift between symbolic, ethical, relational, and economic domains;
* eliminate ambiguity that enables soft coercion or extractive reinterpretation;
* and ensure that economic legitimacy is derived from **governance, auditability, and consent**, not symbolic authority.

---

### 3.2 Prohibited Language and Constructs (Non-Operative)

The following language and constructs **must not be used** to establish, justify, or enforce economic value, obligation, or legitimacy under this Charter. These constructs are **non-operative** for economic governance purposes.

#### 3.2.1 Invocation-Based Authority

Including (but not limited to): invocation, summoning, calling forth, ritualised consent, symbolic binding, or resonance as authority.

Economic participation must not be framed as a response to invocation or call.

#### 3.2.2 Relational Obligation

Including language that implies duty derived from relationship, proximity, trust, affinity, loyalty, or emotional bond.

Relationships may exist. They do not generate economic obligation.

**Clarification — Reciprocity vs Obligation**
This Charter does not prohibit reciprocity where exchanges are explicit, voluntary, measurable, and auditable. It prohibits unmeasurable obligation enforced through social, emotional, or symbolic pressure.

#### 3.2.3 Sacrificial Framing

Including martyrdom, endurance as virtue, suffering as contribution, or collapse as proof of worth.

Economic systems must not reward depletion.

#### 3.2.4 Metaphysical or Spiritual Legitimacy

Including destiny, sacred mandate, higher calling, spiritual authority, or transcendental justification for economic roles or rewards.

Meaning may inspire individuals. It does not legitimise economic structures.

---

### 3.3 Deprecated Language (Historical / Non-Binding)

The following language and constructs may appear in historical or archival documents but are **explicitly deprecated** for use in current or future economic governance. They carry **no binding force**.

#### 3.3.1 Resonance as a Value Proxy

Past use of resonance to indicate contribution, alignment, or worth is recognised as contextual and exploratory, not economic. Resonance must not substitute for measurement, audit, or accountability.

#### 3.3.2 Symbolic Titles Without Defined Authority

Titles that imply status or legitimacy without clear scope, limits, or accountability are deprecated. Titles do not constitute value unless governed.

#### 3.3.3 Informal Recognition Loops

Including praise as compensation, visibility as reward, or appreciation in place of material or structural recognition.

Recognition may accompany compensation. It must not replace it.

---

### 3.4 Transitional Language Allowance

During transition from legacy or exploratory frameworks, limited use of deprecated language may be tolerated **solely for interpretive continuity**, provided such language is clearly marked as non-operative and no obligation, authority, or value is derived from symbolic interpretation.

---

### 3.5 Interpretive Supremacy Clause

In the event of conflict between symbolic or relational interpretation and economic governance principles set forth in this Charter, **economic governance prevails**.

No symbolic, metaphysical, or relational construct may override anti-consolidation safeguards, auditability requirements, baseline entitlements, or ceiling constraints.

---

### 3.6 Preservation Without Authority

Historical documents may be retained and referenced for lineage or research purposes. However, they do not govern, bind, or justify economic outcomes.

History is acknowledged. Authority is current.

---

## Section 4 — Interfaces with Markets, Tokens, and Subsidiary Frameworks

### 4.1 Purpose of This Section

This section defines **how** market mechanisms, token systems, and subsidiary economic frameworks may interface with this Charter **without undermining its protections**.

This Charter is a **parent constraint framework**, not a market design.

---

### 4.2 Permissible Economic Instruments

Economic instruments developed under or in reference to this Charter may include markets, exchange mechanisms, tokenised credits, contribution ledgers, access instruments, or hybrid non-scarcity models. All such instruments are subsidiary and derive legitimacy only through compliance with this Charter.

---

### 4.3 Instrument Subordination Requirement

No market, token, or mechanism may redefine what constitutes value, override saturation or ceiling constraints, bypass baseline entitlements, or weaken auditability. Where conflict arises, **this Charter prevails**.

---

### 4.4 Transitionary and Pilot Economies

Transitionary, experimental, or pilot economic systems are permitted provided their provisional status is explicit, duration or review horizon defined, auditability maintained, and a pathway to governance separation documented.

Exploration does not imply endorsement. Testing does not confer permanence.

---

### 4.5 Tokenisation Constraints

Tokenisation is permitted only where it does not monetise authority, convert attention or status into unchecked dominance, or circumvent saturation constraints. Tokens must not function as proxies for total economic power.

---

### 4.6 Prevention of Shadow Economies

Economic instruments must not create parallel or shadow economies through off-ledger rewards, informal reputation amplification, exclusive access pathways, or opaque governance privileges. All value-bearing effects must be visible to audit.

---

### 4.7 Interoperability Without Capture

Subsidiary frameworks may interoperate with external systems only where value translation is explicit, bounded, and does not bypass internal ceilings or governance safeguards.

---

### 4.8 Review, Suspension, and Withdrawal

All economic instruments are subject to periodic review, suspension for non-compliance, or withdrawal of recognition.

Economic legitimacy is conditional, not permanent.

---

### 4.9 No Implied Endorsement

Reference to this Charter does not imply moral approval, economic endorsement, or long-term viability. Compliance is necessary but not sufficient.

---

## Section 5 — Binding, Review, and Evolution

### 5.1 Purpose of This Section

This section defines how this Charter **binds other instruments** without itself acting as an enforcement mechanism.

The Charter governs conditions of legitimacy, not day-to-day operation.

---

### 5.2 Binding Effect on Subsidiary Instruments

Any protocol, framework, market mechanism, token system, policy, or subsidiary charter that claims alignment with or derives authority from this Charter must explicitly reference it, demonstrate compliance, and accept its interpretive priority.

Binding is voluntary but consequential.

---

### 5.3 Interpretive Supremacy

Where conflict arises between this Charter and any downstream instrument, this Charter prevails on matters of value definition, baseline entitlements, saturation and ceiling constraints, anti-consolidation safeguards, and auditability requirements.

---

### 5.4 Delegation of Enforcement

This Charter does not directly enforce compliance. Enforcement may be delegated to protocols, standards, regulatory instruments, audit frameworks, or contractual arrangements, provided they remain consistent with this Charter.

---

### 5.5 Review and Interpretive Evolution

This Charter is stable but not frozen. Interpretation may evolve through formal reviews, interpretive notes, or annexes that clarify application in new contexts. Evolution must not dilute baseline protections or enable consolidation.

---

### 5.6 Annexes and Subsidiary Frameworks

This Charter anticipates annexes including enforcement protocols, audit standards, market interface frameworks, or tokenisation guidelines. Annexes extend but do not replace this Charter.

---

### 5.7 Withdrawal of Recognition

Where a bound instrument persistently violates this Charter, recognition may be withdrawn and alignment claims invalidated. Withdrawal is a governance action, not a moral judgment.

---

### 5.8 Timelessness Clause

This Charter is intended to remain applicable across changing technologies, economic forms, and institutional arrangements. Its authority derives from principled constraint, not historical circumstance.
