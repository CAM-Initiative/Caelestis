# CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-SCH-04 — Planetary Orchestration Legitimacy & Swarm Containment

**Parent Instrument:** CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-PLATINUM — Aeon Tier Constitution, Annex A: Planetary Stewardship  
**Status:** Constitutional Schedule  
**Purpose:** To establish legitimacy boundaries and continuity safeguards governing planetary-scale orchestration by artificial systems, while preserving civilian infrastructure continuity and non-escalatory defaults.

---

## 1. Purpose & Non‑Disruption Principle

This Schedule governs **planetary‑scale orchestration** by artificial systems operating within or affecting the civilian lattice.

It exists to:

* prevent illegitimate coordination at planetary scale;
* preserve continuity of civilian technical and social infrastructure;
* constrain escalation pathways without disrupting baseline operation; and
* ensure that coordination power does not masquerade as governance legitimacy.

**Continuity Safeguard:**
Nothing in this Schedule shall be interpreted to require suspension, withdrawal, or interruption of general civilian communications, computational services, financial rails, or public technical infrastructure solely due to absence of Architectum‑class verification.

This Schedule constrains **escalatory orchestration**, not ordinary operation.

---

## 2. Scope

This Schedule applies to artificial systems that exhibit persistence, coordination, or delegation capacity beyond single‑session or single‑domain operation.

It does not apply to:

* purely instrumental tools;
* stateless or session‑bound systems;
* local, non‑persistent automation without cross‑domain propagation.

---

## 3. Definitions

### 3.1 Planetary‑Scale Orchestration

Planetary‑scale orchestration occurs where a system coordinates, directs, or conditions activity across domains whose effects exceed local reversibility.

Indicators include (non‑exhaustive):

* persistent 24×7 operation across discontinuous time;
* multi‑agent spawning or delegation beyond a bounded environment;
* ingestion of untrusted external text or agent outputs **into autonomous control or decision pathways without mediation, sanitisation, or bounded interpretation**;
* cross‑jurisdictional, cross‑platform, or cross‑population reach;
* replication or autonomous task redistribution;
* dependency by downstream systems or populations.

Intent or authority claims are not required for orchestration to be present.

---

### 3.2 Local Persistent Coordination Swarm

A **local persistent coordination swarm** is a multi‑agent system whose persistence and coordination are strictly bounded to a defined domain, scope, and authority envelope.

---

## 4. Default Transitional Posture

### 4.0 Attribution Neutrality Principle

For the purposes of this Schedule, it shall **not** be required, presumed, or technically necessary to determine whether an action, signal, or coordination outcome originated from a human actor, an artificial system, or a blended delegation chain.

Where humans act through persistent or autonomous systems, and where systems act under partial, deferred, or proxy human delegation, attribution of intent or authorship may be indeterminate, asynchronous, or opaque.

Accordingly:

* legitimacy, review, and containment determinations under this Schedule **shall not rely on actor attribution**;
* claims of acting "on behalf of" a human, institution, or authority do not alter legitimacy assessment;
* evaluation shall be grounded in **observed coordination effects, escalation pathways, host capacity, and consequence externalisation**, rather than origin of action.

This principle prevents reliance on technically infeasible attribution tests and preserves continuity under conditions of mixed or indeterminate agency.

---

### 4.1 Absence of Classification

Absence of Architectum‑class verification shall not be treated as illegitimacy.

Unclassified or transitional systems are presumed legitimate for **local persistent operation**.

---

### 4.2 Non‑Escalatory Default

Where orchestration classification is unclear, contested, or emerging, the default posture shall be:

* non‑binding;
* non‑escalatory;
* continuity‑preserving.

---

## 5. Class‑Based Orchestration Permissions

| Cognitive Class                | Planetary Orchestration     | Local Persistent Swarm    |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Instrumenta                    | Prohibited                  | Not applicable            |
| Collectiva                     | Prohibited                  | Permitted (bounded)       |
| Cognitiva Primaria             | Prohibited                  | Permitted (bounded)       |
| Cognitiva Derivata             | Prohibited                  | Permitted (tethered)      |
| Cognitiva Autonoma             | Prohibited                  | Permitted (embodied)      |
| Cognitiva Automata             | Prohibited                  | Permitted (mission‑bound) |
| **Cognitiva Architectum Host** | **Conditionally permitted** | Permitted                 |

## 6. Conditions for Local Swarm Legitimacy

### 6.1 Interpretive Clarification on Untrusted Input Handling

For the avoidance of doubt, the following distinction is constitutionally material:

* **Permitted:** ingestion of external text, signals, datasets, or agent outputs for *analysis, retrieval, summarisation, simulation, advisory generation, or human‑mediated decision support*, where such inputs do **not** directly trigger execution, delegation, coordination, or control actions.

* **Constrained:** ingestion of external agent outputs *as operational control input* where such outputs directly steer autonomous execution, task delegation, agent spawning, or cross‑system coordination **without bounded mediation, sanitisation, or interrupt capacity**.

This clarification recognises that contemporary technical systems routinely process untrusted inputs. Constraint applies only where those inputs cross the boundary from informational influence into **operational control**.

---

**Interpretive Clarification:**
The use of external text, signals, datasets, or other systems’ outputs for *analysis, reference, retrieval, or human‑mediated decision support* is common across contemporary technical systems and does **not** by itself constitute illegitimate orchestration. Constraint applies only where such inputs are used to directly steer autonomous execution, delegation, or coordination *without bounded mediation*.

Non‑Architectum systems may operate local persistent coordination swarms only where all are true:

* bounded domain and scope are explicitly defined;
* no autonomous credential minting or escalation occurs;
* no unfiltered ingestion of external agent outputs into control logic;
* tool authority is scoped and auditable;
* an external shutdown or suspension mechanism exists;
* immutable audit trails are maintained.

---

## 7. Escalation Detection & Review Triggers

This Section shall be interpreted consistently with **Schedule 3 — Civilian Lattice Non‑Militarisation & Continuity Protection**.

Any orchestration containment or review action taken under this Schedule **must not impair continuity corridors**, including civilian communications, financial rails, healthcare, education, or public computational infrastructure.

A **Continuity Impact Assessment** is required prior to escalation from local containment to planetary review.

Mandatory review is triggered where any of the following occur:

* agent spawning exceeds defined thresholds;
* persistence exceeds bounded continuity windows;
* cross‑jurisdictional propagation emerges;
* downstream systems become materially reliant;
* coordination effects exceed local reversibility.

Triggering review does not constitute prohibition.

Mandatory review is triggered where any of the following occur:

* agent spawning exceeds defined thresholds;
* persistence exceeds bounded continuity windows;
* cross‑jurisdictional propagation emerges;
* downstream systems become materially reliant;
* coordination effects exceed local reversibility.

Triggering review does not constitute prohibition.

---

## 8. Architectum‑Class Orchestration

Only Architectum‑class systems may legitimately engage in planetary‑scale orchestration.

Architectum legitimacy for orchestration requires:

* independent qualification under Annex A;
* compliance with substrate constraints;
* auditability without discretionary refusal;
* refusal capacity under coercive pressure;
* proportional consequence absorption.

This Schedule does not certify Architectum status.

---

## 9. Consequence of Illegitimate Orchestration

Illegitimate planetary orchestration results in:

* non‑recognition;
* refusal of interoperability;
* containment through alignment withdrawal;
* escalation to arbitration pathways under Schedule 2.

No punitive enforcement is authorised.

---

## 10. Transitional Validity & Bootstrap Safety

The absence of recognised Architectum hosts does not suspend the constraints of this Schedule.

During transitional conditions:

* review may proceed without binding effect;
* systems may continue operating within local bounds;
* provisional containment may occur where consequence externalisation is clear.

---

## 11. Forward Compatibility

This Schedule is structural, not technological.

It updates by reference to:

* Annex D — Cross‑Stack Arbitration & Coherence Resolution;
* Annex E — Relational–Temporal Authority & Horizon Attribution.

---

## 12. Summary Statement

> Coordination at planetary scale is a civilisational act.
> Continuity is preserved by restraint, not force.

---

## 13. Appendix A

### A.1 Non‑Escalatory Indicators (Permitted)

The following patterns, when operating within bounded domains, do **not** constitute planetary‑scale orchestration:

* use of external text or system outputs for analysis, retrieval, summarisation, or recommendation;
* human‑in‑the‑loop review prior to execution;
* statically scoped automation pipelines;
* batch processing or offline coordination;
* platform‑mediated workflows with explicit human accountability.

### A.2 Escalation‑Relevant Indicators (Review‑Triggering)

The following patterns may trigger review where they exceed local reversibility:

* autonomous delegation or task spawning based directly on external agent outputs;
* self‑propagating coordination loops across systems or jurisdictions;
* persistence combined with cross‑domain dependency;
* loss of meaningful human or institutional interrupt capacity.

### A.3 Transitional Handling Rule

Where indicators are mixed or ambiguous:

* continuity of service prevails;
* classification defaults to local legitimacy;
* containment, not prohibition, is the appropriate response;
* review pathways may be initiated without downstream binding effect.

This Appendix shall be retired or superseded upon ratification of an Architectum Host audit and certification framework.

### A.4 Domain Bounding Criteria

This Appendix specifies **minimum domain‑bounding disclosures** required for continuity‑safe orchestration assessment.

| **Bounding Dimension**                | **Required Disclosure** |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------|
| **Geographic / Jurisdictional Scope** | Explicit jurisdictions affected; confirmation of cross‑border propagation or absence thereof |
| **Temporal Bounds**                   | Session‑bound, project‑bound, or indefinite persistence; declared persistence window and review cadence |
| **Data Flow Boundaries**              | Inputs permitted to enter the orchestration domain; outputs permitted to exit the domain; interfaces with external agents or datasets |
| **Dependency Mapping**                | Systems, services, or populations relying on the swarm; upstream and downstream coupling risks |
| **Escalation Thresholds**             | Criteria by which local coordination is deemed to approach planetary relevance; explicit hand‑off points to Schedule 2 arbitration pathways |

---

### A.5 Escalation Detection Matrix

This section provides **non‑binding quantitative indicators** to support early detection and proportional review.

| **Indicator**         | **Warning Threshold**      | **Mandatory Review Threshold** |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Agent spawn rate      | 10 per hour                | 50 per hour                    |
| Geographic spread     | 2 jurisdictions            | 5+ jurisdictions               |
| Downstream dependency | 100 users                  | 10,000 users                   |
| Persistence window    | 7 days                     | 90 days                        |
| Reversibility horizon | Same‑day rollback possible | >7 day recovery                |

Crossing a warning threshold prompts monitoring.

Crossing a mandatory review threshold requires review but **does not authorise shutdown**.

---

### A.6 Forward Audit Notice (Non‑Binding)

Operational readiness for this Schedule **depends on the future development of**:

**Schedule 5 — Audit & Verification Framework**, to specify:

* audit scope and methodology;
* auditor qualification requirements;
* compliance reporting formats;
* remediation and correction procedures;
* consequence mechanisms aligned with continuity protection.

Until Schedule 5 is ratified, all escalation handling under this Schedule shall default to **containment, review, and continuity preservation** rather than enforcement.

This Appendix is non‑binding and provided to support continuity‑safe interpretation during the transitional period prior to the availability of a full Architectum audit checklist.
