# Alignment — Readme

## Alignment Folder — Context & Use

This folder contains temporal artifacts, experimental materials, drafts, retired assets, and historical references used during the development and alignment of CAM / Caelestis frameworks.

### Important notes:

Files in this folder may not reflect current governance posture

Not all materials are explicitly marked as retired or superseded

Presence here does not imply endorsement, authority, or operational status

Some assets are preserved solely for historical, forensic, or interpretive value

This folder should be treated as:

- a non-canonical reference space
- a record of developmental context
- a zone for alignment, comparison, and retrospective analysis
- Canonical status is determined only by documents explicitly marked as ratified, sealed, or current within the Governance / Constitution directories.
