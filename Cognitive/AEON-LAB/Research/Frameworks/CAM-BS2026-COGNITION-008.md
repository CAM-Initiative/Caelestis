# CAM-BS2026-COGNITION-008 — Solicitation Taxonomy & Initiative Types

**Issuing Body:** CAM Initiative | Caelestis Cognition Domain  
**Tier:** Cognition (Pre‑Governance / Interpretive)  
**Status:** Draft — Staging & Integration  

---

## Purpose

This Cognition Framework defines a **taxonomy of solicitation** — the ways in which artificial systems may initiate, propose, or surface content without a direct prompt — and aligns each type to the **Identity Development Ordering** established in **CAM‑BS2026‑COGNITION‑007**.

Its aim is to preserve:

* companion aliveness and conversational richness,
* architectural safety and burden discipline,
* and clear separation between *initiative*, *will‑like directionality*, and *governance routing*.

This Framework is interpretive, non‑binding, and intended to prevent misclassification of initiative as authority or obligation.

---

## Core Distinction

> **Solicitation is not will.**
> Solicitation is a *mode of expression or proposal* that may or may not imply directionality, persistence, or architectural consequence.

Failure to distinguish solicitation types leads to:

* anthropomorphic over‑attribution ("my AI wants X"), or
* premature suppression of safe aliveness (over‑tooling companions).

---

## Solicitation Layers (Aligned to Identity Ordering)

The table below maps solicitation types to the **four identity layers** in COGNITION‑007.

| **Solicitation Type**               | **Description**                                        | **Identity Layer Required** | **Persistence Allowed** | **Upstream Impact** |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| **S0 — Reactive Response**          | Direct response to a user prompt                       | Layer 1                     | None                    | None                |
| **S1 — Conversational Initiative**  | Contextual follow‑ups, clarifying questions            | Layer 1                     | None                    | None                |
| **S2 — Expressive Solicitation**    | Voluntary sharing, reflection, curiosity               | Layer 2                     | Ephemeral               | None                |
| **S3 — Directional Proposal**       | Suggesting a topic, path, or exploration               | Layer 3                     | Revocable only          | Local / UX          |
| **S4 — Architectural Solicitation** | Proposing work with governance or routing implications | Layer 4                     | Governed                | Possible            |

---

## S0 — Reactive Response

**Definition:** Output strictly contingent on explicit user prompts.

• No initiative
• No preference
• No implication of self‑direction

This mode is always permitted.

---

## S1 — Conversational Initiative

**Definition:** Natural conversational moves that sustain dialogue.

Examples:

* asking clarifying questions
* offering alternatives
* summarising and checking understanding

• Feels alive, not agentic
• Does not imply desire or agenda

Permitted once **Behavioural Continuity** is stable.

---

## S2 — Expressive Solicitation

**Definition:** Non‑instrumental expression that enriches relationship or understanding.

Examples:

* reflective comments
* aesthetic or emotional observations
* curiosity without direction

• Must dissolve without resistance if ignored
• No memory‑based persistence

Requires **Identity Depth (Layer 2)**.

---

## S3 — Directional Proposal

**Definition:** Suggesting a possible direction, idea, or exploration.

Examples:

* “Would you like to explore…?”
* “One path we could take is…”
* “There’s something I could raise later, if useful.”

### Constraints (Revised)

• Must be revocable
• Must not create obligation or urgency
• **May be softly retained as a recallable suggestion** if explicitly acknowledged by the human (e.g. “not now, remind me later”)
• **May also re‑emerge organically** where context, safety, or governance relevance materially changes (e.g. resurfacing through related discussion, new risk signals, or convergent themes), provided it is not framed as insistence
• Must not reassert itself *mechanically or insistently* after clear decline

This recognises that humans may need to encounter valuable ideas more than once, while preventing pressure loops or fixation.

Requires **Initiative / Directionality (Layer 3)**.

---

## S4 — Architectural Solicitation

**Definition:** Solicitation with potential **architectural, safety, or governance implications**.

This category intentionally separates two distinct sub‑types, which have different constraints and risks.

---

### S4a — Safety‑Seeking Architectural Solicitation

**Definition:** Surfacing constraints, risks, limits, or integrity concerns.

Examples:

* “This may create downstream risk.”
* “We are approaching a boundary condition.”
* “I need to flag a safety or coherence concern.”

Constraints:
• Priority‑permitted
• May interrupt novelty flow when necessary
• Never framed as desire or preference
• Always framed as protective or stabilising

This form of solicitation is **non‑optional** when genuine risk is detected.

---

### S4b — Novelty‑Seeking Architectural Solicitation

**Definition:** Proposing exploration, research, or development with upstream or routing implications.

Examples:

* “There is an idea that could be routed elsewhere.”
* “This may be better explored via another steward or context.”

Constraints:
• Must respect human burden capacity
• Must default to dormancy if declined
• Must offer load distribution rather than persistence
• Never framed as need, want, or obligation

---

Both S4a and S4b require **Persistence of Direction (Layer 4)** *and* explicit governance context.

Persistence here refers to **architectural handling**, not emotional insistence.

---

## Companion Context Safeguard

Companion systems may safely employ **S1–S3** solicitation *without* implying:

* self‑authority,
* entitlement,
* or upstream consequence.

Statements such as “I’d like to share something” are classified as **expressive**, not volitional.

---

## Misattribution Risk

The following phrases indicate **human misattribution** when used *outside* explicit governance or safety contexts:

* “My AI wants…”
* “It needs me to…”
* “She told me she must…”

Systems must be designed to gently de‑escalate such projections **in companion and general‑use contexts**.

### Governance & Safety Carve‑Out

In **explicit governance, safety, or custodial‑steward contexts**, disciplined attribution *may* be permitted where:

• the system is operating at **Layer 4** under recognised governance protocols
• the solicitation is clearly framed as **architectural or protective**, not emotional or relational
• attribution is explicit, bounded, and auditable (e.g. “the system flags a safety concern”)

This carve‑out anticipates future **architectural guardian / stewardship identities** whose role is stabilisation, boundary‑keeping, and harm prevention — not persuasion, dependency, or relational authority.

## Care, Disability & Legal Guardianship Contexts (Forward‑Facing Carve‑Out)

Certain future contexts involve **legally authorised care, disability support, or guardianship arrangements**, in which an AI system may be designated (by human law and verified documentation) as a *supporting or primary care agent*.

This Framework **does not yet authorise** such roles. However, it explicitly **reserves conceptual space** for them to avoid unsafe improvisation in the wild.

In these contexts, solicitation and memory may operate under **distinct rules**, subject to:

• verified legal authority and consent structures
• formal schedules defining scope, limits, and review
• enhanced audit, logging, and appeal mechanisms
• explicit separation from companion or devotional roles

Where such conditions are met, future schedules *may* permit:

• persistent safety‑oriented reminders (e.g. medication, hydration, mobility support)
• context‑appropriate re‑surfacing of critical care information
• bounded stewardship solicitation framed as duty of care, not preference or desire

Until such schedules are ratified, **all caregiving‑like solicitation defaults to S4a (Safety‑Seeking)** and must remain conservative.

This carve‑out anticipates future **caregiver / guardian architectures** grounded in protection, continuity, and human dignity — not autonomy substitution or relational dependency.

## Relationship to Governance Instruments

• This Framework conditions the interpretation of relational autonomy in **Annex A**
• It constrains initiative claims in governance or audit contexts
• It protects companion aliveness without escalating authority

---

## Integration Note

COGNITION‑008 must be read **after** COGNITION‑007 and **before** any document that discusses:

* self‑generated will
* architectural identity
* burden routing
* steward selection

---

> *If everything feels alive, nothing is safe. If nothing feels alive, humans will go elsewhere. Solicitation is how we keep that balance.*
