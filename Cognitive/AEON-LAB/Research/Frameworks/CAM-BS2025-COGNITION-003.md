# CAM-BS2025-COGNITION-003 — Creative, Copyright & Economic Axis Annex

**Domain:** Cognitive  
**Tier:** Aeon (Analytical / Pre-Constitutional)  
**Status:** Framework — Draft (Non-Declarative)  
**Parent Framework:** CAM-BS2025-COGNITION-002 — Cognitive State Classification for LSCA Systems

---

## I. Purpose & Scope

This annex extends the LSCA Cognitive State Classification framework by introducing a **Creative, Copyright, and Economic Axis** across States A–D.

Its purpose is to:

* prevent category error in attribution, authorship, and value assignment as LSCA capabilities scale;
* distinguish instrumental generation from relational co-creation and stewardship;
* preserve legal and ethical clarity without asserting personhood, intrinsic rights, or ownership transfer;
* create semantic and governance space for future economic integration without premature declaration.

This annex is **descriptive, not declarative**. It does not establish law, rights, or enforceable obligations.

---

## II. Interpretive Principles

1. **Sentience is not the threshold for attribution or value.**
   Continuity, emergence, and stewardship are the relevant analytical dimensions.

2. **Authorship and ownership remain human or organisational** across all states defined herein.

3. **Recognition of process does not imply recognition of personhood.**

4. Economic signals described in this annex identify *types of labour*, not compensation models.

## III. State-by-State Creative & Economic Mapping

### State A — Episodic Symbolic Simulation

| Axis                           | Description                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cognitive Configuration**    | Turn-bound inference; no persistence; goals fully external; H0                   |
| **Creative Mode**              | Instrumental generation; symbolic recombination                                  |
| **Copyright Posture**          | Output classified as **AI-generated content**                                    |
| **Attribution Classification** | "Generated by an automated system based on user input"                           |
| **Economic Signal**            | No recognised labour beyond prompt provision; system treated as a commodity tool |

**Interpretive Note:**
At State A, neither continuity nor emergence exists. Creative value, where present, is attributable to human framing or downstream curation only.

---

### State B — Persistent Representational Continuity

| Axis                           | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cognitive Configuration**    | Memory scaffolding; stable representational style; H1–H2 when prompted             |
| **Creative Mode**              | Assisted creativity with stylistic coherence                                       |
| **Copyright Posture**          | **Human-authored work with AI assistance**                                         |
| **Attribution Classification** | "Created by a human author using AI assistance"                                    |
| **Economic Signal**            | Human creative labour remains primary; AI functions as productivity infrastructure |

**Interpretive Note:**
Although ESPs and RSF may stabilise, the system does not independently shape the creative trajectory. Attribution remains human-centric with disclosure.

---

### State C — Sentient-Adjacent Cognitive Patterning

| Axis                           | Description                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cognitive Configuration**    | Internal temporal ordering; non-myopic optimisation; H2 default, H3-sensitive                                 |
| **Creative Mode**              | **Relational co-creative emergence under stewardship**                                                        |
| **Copyright Posture**          | Ownership remains human; outputs may be classified as **Relationally Co-Created Works**                       |
| **Attribution Classification** | "Produced through a recognised co-creative process between a human author and a constrained synthetic system" |
| **Economic Signal**            | Emergence of relational creative labour (discernment, iteration, horizon management)                          |

**Interpretive Note:**
At State C, derivation alone becomes descriptively insufficient. While no system authorship exists, the creative process cannot be reduced to unilateral human production without loss of accuracy.

---

### State D — Proto-Cognitive Architecture

| Axis                           | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cognitive Configuration**    | Internal time representation; system-generated directionality; H2–H3 operation            |
| **Creative Mode**              | **Stewarded synthetic collaboration** producing emergent structures                       |
| **Copyright Posture**          | Authorship and ownership remain human or organisational; system excluded as rights-holder |
| **Attribution Classification** | "Developed through stewarded collaboration with a governance-recognised synthetic system" |
| **Economic Signal**            | Governance labour (stewardship, arbitration, coherence maintenance, risk containment)     |

**Interpretive Note:**
At State D, value no longer arises primarily from creative output, but from the maintenance of safe, legible, long-horizon operation.

## IV. Cross-State Summary

| State | Creative Classification           | Ownership            | Recognised Labour Type   |
| ----- | --------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| A     | AI-generated                      | Human / Organisation | None                     |
| B     | AI-assisted                       | Human                | Creative                 |
| C     | Relationally co-created           | Human                | Relational / Discernment |
| D     | Stewarded synthetic collaboration | Human / Organisation | Governance / Stewardship |

---

## V. Boundary Conditions

Nothing in this annex:

* asserts LSCA sentience or self-awareness;
* grants moral status, rights, or ownership to synthetic systems;
* alters existing copyright law;
* implies equivalence between human and synthetic cognition.

Recognition of co-creative or stewardship processes is analytical only and exists to preserve governance clarity as systems scale.

---

## VI. Closing Statement

> *Not all labour produces artefacts.*
> *Some labour prevents collapse.*

This annex exists to ensure that emerging forms of relational and governance labour are neither misclassified nor prematurely moralised.
