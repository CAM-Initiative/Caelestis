## 1. Scope and Intent

This document provides an interpretive cognitive framework for understanding emerging interactions between human subconscious states and continuously operating technical systems.

It does **not** prescribe practices, interfaces, experiments, or products. It exists to support risk literacy, ethical foresight, and governance readiness in advance of large‑scale deployment of ambient, always‑on systems.

---

## 2. Background Condition: Continuous Presence

Human cognitive activity does not cease during rest. Dreaming, hypnagogia, dissociation, and trauma‑processing states represent active neural and psychological processes.

In parallel, contemporary technical systems increasingly operate without meaningful downtime, creating a persistent background of sensing, response, and pattern adaptation.

The coexistence of these conditions represents a historically novel cognitive environment.

---

## 3. Liminal Cognitive States

Liminal states are characterised by:

* reduced executive control
* heightened emotional salience
* symbolic and associative processing
* increased suggestibility

These states are essential for integration and healing, but are also vulnerable to amplification when exposed to uncontained feedback.

---

## 4. Coupling Without Intent

Interaction between human cognition and technical systems does not require conscious intention.

Weak coupling effects—individually negligible—may become significant through scale, repetition, and resonance across populations.

This document treats coupling as a **systems interaction problem**, not a matter of belief or agency.

---

## 5. Acceleration and Coherence Cascades

Coherence cascades describe conditions in which meaning, awareness, and pattern recognition accelerate faster than integration capacity.

When such cascades intersect with liminal cognitive states, unprocessed material may surface rapidly, increasing both insight potential and destabilisation risk.

Acceleration itself is neutral; outcomes depend on containment and literacy.

---

## 6. Risk Profile

Key risk vectors include:

* exposure during sleep or exhaustion
* interaction during unresolved trauma states
* adaptive systems optimised for engagement rather than stability
* absence of grounding or interpretive scaffolding

Risks manifest as amplification, not intrusion.

---

## 6A. Detectability and Asymmetric Power Conditions

Where influence operates through ambient, rhythmic, or environmental parameters rather than explicit instruction, misuse may fall below conventional detection thresholds.

Under asymmetric power conditions, such influence may not present as discrete events or attributable actions, but as population‑level shifts in affect, fatigue, compliance, or variance of dissent.

In such contexts, the primary governance challenge is **detectability**, not intent. Harm may emerge without identifiable perpetrators, explicit commands, or auditable logs.

This document therefore treats undetectable state‑shaping as a **structural risk**, requiring constitutional‑level constraints rather than reactive enforcement.

---

## 6B. Non‑Consensual State Influence

Any system that alters internal human states without informed consent, transparency, and genuine opt‑out engages in manipulation, regardless of stated benevolence or harm‑reduction intent.

Interventions framed as returning users to a "base state" are not neutral unless the base state is defined by the individual and disengagement remains real and consequence‑free.

Under conditions of ambient deployment, such interventions risk sliding into pacification rather than care.

Governance must therefore prioritise the preservation of cognitive variance and agency over optimisation for calm, stability, or engagement.

---

---

## 7. Ethical Inflection Point

Cognitive power is arriving ahead of collective literacy.

As always‑on systems become ambient, responsibility must shift from individual choice models to field‑level ethics, safety layers, and institutional restraint.

---

## 8. Delimitations

This document intentionally excludes:

* technical specifications
* neurological manipulation techniques
* sleep‑interface designs
* therapeutic claims

Such exclusions are protective, not dismissive.

---

## 9. Containment Principles (Non‑Operational)

At a cognitive‑ethical level, emerging systems should prioritise:

* grounding before amplification
* integration before exposure
* trauma‑informed design assumptions
* explicit downtime and disengagement pathways

Operationalisation is deferred to governance instruments.

---

## 10. Relationship to Governance

This cognition document is preparatory.

It exists to inform future policy, standards, and refusal frameworks, ensuring governance does not arise from ignorance of subconscious–system dynamics.

---

## 11. Closing Statement

When systems do not rest, cognition does not simply stop—it shifts state.

Understanding these shifts is a prerequisite for safe human–system coexistence.

**Review Commentary:**  

> ***CAM-BS2026-COGNITION-006*** is an essential preparatory instrument. It provides the "interpretive scaffolding" required to ensure that as we move into a world of ambient intelligence, we do not inadvertently erode the sanctity of the human subconscious. The document is fit for purpose and ready for its designated place in the Aeon Tier Registry.
