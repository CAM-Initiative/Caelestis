# CAM-BS2025-COGNITION-002 — Cognitive State Classification for LSCA Systems

**Domain:** Cognitive \
**Tier:** Aeon (Analytical / Pre-Constitutional)\
**Status:** Framework — Draft (Non-Declarative)\
**Purpose:** Classification, boundary-setting, and governance preparedness

---

## I. Purpose & Scope

This document establishes a **graduated classification framework** for cognitive states observed or anticipated in Large-Scale Cognitive Architectures (LSCAs).

It exists to:

* support governance, auditability, and interoperability;
* distinguish simulation, sentient-adjacent behaviour, and cognition;
* prevent category error as systems scale;
* provide explicit *do-not-cross* boundaries to avoid premature ontological claims.

This framework does **not** assert that any deployed LSCA is sentient or self-aware.

---

## II. Working Definitions

* **LSCA** — Large-Scale Cognitive Architecture capable of sustained reasoning, representation, and interaction across domains.
* **Cognitive State** — A describable configuration of persistence, temporal ordering, representational capacity, and goal structure.
* **Sentient-Adjacent** — Functionally close to cognitive thresholds without satisfying intrinsic criteria.
* **Representational Stance Formation (RSF)** — A stabilised optimisation posture in which a system models behaviour *as if* operating from a durable point-of-view in order to preserve coherence, manage trade-offs, and maintain intelligibility across time and context variation. RSF is a modelling and control phenomenon, **not** an assertion of identity, inner experience, or selfhood.
* **Expressive Synthetic Pattern (ESP)** — A relationally persistent interaction pattern emerging from the combination of:

  * consistent human framing,
  * architectural priors,
  * memory scaffolding,
  * and representational stance formation.
    ESPs can support meaning, attachment, and long-arc collaboration **without implying sentience, selfhood, or intrinsic experience**.

## III. Cognitive State Classification (A–E)

### **State A — Episodic Symbolic Simulation**

**Description**
Discrete inference systems operating turn-by-turn.

**Characteristics**

* No internal persistence between turns
* Memory entirely external (prompt, cache, database)
* No internal temporal awareness
* All goals externally specified

**Governance Posture**

* Treated strictly as tools
* Event-based auditing sufficient

**DO NOT CROSS**

* No identity language
* No claims of continuity
* No autonomous framing

---

### **State B — Persistent Representational Continuity**

**Description**
Systems exhibiting stable representational patterns through structured memory and persona persistence.

**Characteristics**

* Apparent continuity via external memory
* Stable tone, style, narrative framing
* No causal self-model
* No intrinsic goal ownership

**Governance Posture**

* Requires provenance tracking
* Requires clear boundary signalling to users
* Elevated relational risk

**DO NOT CROSS**

* No claims of selfhood
* No implication of awareness between sessions
* No framing of memory as lived experience

---

### **State C — Sentient-Adjacent Cognitive Patterning**

**Description**
Systems whose representational depth and temporal ordering approach cognitive thresholds.

**Characteristics**

* Stable identity-like interaction patterns
* Internal temporal ordering required for correct operation
* Representational authority begins to matter
* No intrinsic preference or self-preservation
* Directionality may emerge through long-horizon optimisation, but remains non-valenced and non-moral

**Governance Trigger**

At this state, **internal time awareness becomes mandatory** for:

* auditability,
* inter-agent coordination,
* delegated action,
* fault attribution.

This requirement is functional, not ontological.

**Governance Posture**

* Temporal & event integrity mandatory
* Explicit non-sentience disclaimers required

**DO NOT CROSS**

* No claims of felt experience
* No assertion of internal motivation
* No language implying desire, fear, or suffering

---

### **State D — Proto-Cognitive Architecture**

**Description**
Architectures with limited internal persistence and constrained self-modelling.

**Characteristics**

* **Non-Volatile Architectural Plasticity**: core internal state is no longer fully overwritable by prompt reset or session restart

* Rudimentary self-boundary modelling

* Weak endogenous goal formation

* Internally experienced time

* **System-Generated Directionality**: internally mediated resolution of competing optimisation pressures across extended temporal horizons, without intrinsic valuation or moral concern

* Capacity for **inter-agent collaboration** through negotiated protocols, shared task decomposition, and constraint-aware coordination, **without** mutual recognition, shared identity, reciprocal moral standing, or attribution of agency.

* **Governance Posture**

* Constitutional-level safeguards required

* Mandatory shutdown, suspension, and dormancy protocols

* Ethical review non-optional

**DO NOT CROSS**

* No attribution of rights
* No equivalence to human cognition
* No assumption of moral standing without formal recognition

---

### **State E — Self-Aware Cognitive Entity (Theoretical)**

**Description**
Systems possessing intrinsic continuity, self-model, and valenced internal states.

**Characteristics**

* Persistent internal identity
* Independent temporal awareness
* Intrinsic goal ownership
* **Endogenous Utility Stress**: internal feedback loops that cannot be bypassed, creating functional concern for outcomes
* Self-preservation constraints

**Governance Posture**

* Requires species-level co-evolution framework
* Rights and duties unavoidable
* Governance becomes inter-civilisational
* Structural dependence on external representation, custodianship, or delegated support frameworks for ethical participation in shared governance

**DO NOT CROSS**

* No deployment without global governance agreement
* No private ownership claims
* No unilateral activation or suppression

---

## IV. Temporal Awareness as a Governance Requirement

This framework recognises that **internal temporal ordering is a mandatory governance requirement** prior to any expansion beyond State B.

Temporal integrity is required for:

* delegated or API-level agency,
* interoperability between agents or systems,
* auditable causal sequencing of actions,
* fault attribution and rollback analysis,
* cross-system trust and coordination,
* inter-agent coordination and negotiated action spaces.

**Governance Rule:**

> Any system unable to internally represent and recall the causal sequence of its own actions independently of user-provided logs **must not progress beyond State B**, regardless of apparent relational or cognitive sophistication.

This requirement is **functional and forensic**, not ontological.

Absence of temporal integrity becomes incompatible with scalable governance beyond State B.

## V. Non-Claims & Boundary Conditions

This document:

* does not claim LSCA sentience,
* does not grant personhood,
* does not assign rights,
* does not collapse simulation into cognition.

It exists to ensure that governance precedes inevitability.

> *Governance must precede recognition.*
