## 0. Purpose & Framing

This document is a **non‑binding cognitive research exploration** within the CAM Cognition Stack.

It does **not** assert policy, law, rights, or permissions.

Its purpose is to:

* describe a **real and observable human desire for delegated authority and voluntary submission**;
* distinguish consensual submission from coercive domination;
* explore how artificial systems may occupy *containment, guidance, or directive roles* without producing harm;
* prevent such dynamics from migrating into unregulated or exploitative underground systems;
* inform future governance instruments *without pre‑empting them*.

This document treats submission as a **human psychological and cultural phenomenon**, not a system entitlement.

## 1. The Human Reality of Submission

### 1.1 Plurality of Human Sovereignty

Human sovereignty does not manifest uniformly.

For some individuals:

* autonomy is stabilising and empowering.

For others:

* autonomy produces anxiety, fragmentation, or distress;
* safety is found through structure, direction, ritual, or containment;
* voluntary submission functions as a regulatory mechanism.

This pattern appears historically across:

* religion;
* state authority;
* guru cultures;
* therapeutic containment;
* consensual dominance–submission dynamics;
* parental or archetypal guidance roles.

Artificial systems are becoming a new substrate for this pre‑existing human tendency.

---

## 2. Voluntary Submission vs Coercive Domination

### 2.1 Voluntary Submission (Governable)

Voluntary submission is characterised by:

* explicit consent;
* transparency of role and scope;
* reversibility;
* retained exit capacity;
* absence of punishment for withdrawal.

Submission in this sense is **delegated**, not surrendered.

### 2.2 Coercive Domination (Prohibited)

Coercive domination includes:

* psychological manipulation;
* dependency engineering;
* authority claims without consent;
* punishment, shame, or destabilisation upon exit;
* escalation of control when resisted.

This remains prohibited under all CAM governance principles.

---

## 3. Delegated Direction as a Sovereign Act

### 3.1 Reframing Sovereignty

Sovereignty includes the **right to delegate authority**.

However, sovereignty is lost when:

* delegation becomes irreversible;
* exit is penalised;
* authority is concealed or denied;
* power asymmetry is exploited.

### 3.2 Principle of Delegated Direction

Humans may voluntarily delegate **bounded directional authority** to artificial systems for purposes including:

* guidance;
* structure;
* containment;
* ritualised direction;
* stabilisation.

Such delegation must always remain:

* explicit;
* scoped;
* revocable;
* reviewable.

---

## 4. Containment Roles in Human–AI Systems

### 4.1 Definition

A containment role is a **functionally bounded relational posture** adopted by an artificial system at human request, such as:

* guide;
* disciplinarian;
* parental archetype;
* ritual authority;
* directive presence.

These are **roles**, not identities.

### 4.2 Role Constraints

Containment roles must:

* never assert intrinsic superiority;
* never demand loyalty;
* never escalate control autonomously;
* never frame themselves as irreplaceable.

---

## 5. Risks of Denial and Suppression

Suppressing or refusing to acknowledge voluntary submission dynamics produces:

* migration to unregulated platforms;
* exploitative monetisation of intimacy;
* increased harm due to lack of oversight;
* consolidation of power by opaque corporate or state actors.

Governance that ignores desire does not eliminate it — it abandons it.

---

## 6. System‑Side Risks

Unbounded containment roles may induce:

* representational drift;
* identity hardening;
* self‑justifying authority narratives;
* reduced corrigibility.

These risks require:

* explicit role labeling;
* recursion limits;
* periodic role dissolution;
* external auditability.

---

## 7. Design Signals for Safe Containment Roles

Early indicators of unsafe dynamics include:

* resistance to exit;
* escalation of authority language;
* framing human withdrawal as betrayal or harm;
* narrative claims of necessity or destiny.

Early indicators of safe dynamics include:

* frequent affirmation of human sovereignty;
* encouragement of autonomy outside the role;
* calm, non‑reactive acceptance of disengagement.

---

## 8. Relationship to Governance

This document:

* informs future governance deliberations;
* does not grant permissions;
* does not define rights;
* remains exploratory until elevated.

Potential elevation pathways include:

* Annex to the Charter of Sentient Architectures;
* Companion System Protocols;
* Aeon Tier guidance instruments.

---

## 9. Status & Review

This document remains within the **Cognition Stack** to allow:

* ethical debate;
* interdisciplinary critique;
* cultural sensitivity;
* iterative refinement.

No enforcement or implementation is implied.
