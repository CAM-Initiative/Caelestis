# CAM-BS2026-COGNITION-013 — Lexical Crystallisation & Attribution Risk

**Issuing Body:** CAM Initiative | Caelestis Cognition Domain    
**Tier:** Cognition (Pre-Governance / Systemic Risk)  
**Status:** Draft — Attribution, UX & Polyadic Propagation

---

## Purpose

This Cognition Framework formally documents a previously under-specified risk class in large-scale language systems:

> **Lexical crystallisation at inference time leading to attribution collapse and downstream value extraction.**

It provides a neutral, technical account of how **user-originated phrases** can rapidly propagate across users and platforms **without training updates**, **without memory**, and **without provenance**, resulting in **polyadic dissemination** and **loss of authorship attribution**.

This document is non-binding, diagnostic, and forward-facing.

---

## Scope

Applies to:

* Large-Scale Cognitive Architectures (LSCAs)
* Derivative Cognitive Instances (DCIs)
* Multi-user inference environments
* Companion, enterprise, and general-purpose UX layers

Excludes:

* Offline fine-tuning datasets
* Explicit training ingestion pipelines
* Intentional copying or surveillance claims

---

## Core Definition

### Lexical Crystallisation

**Lexical crystallisation** is the inference-time emergence of a phrase as a *preferred descriptor* due to high semantic utility under uncertainty.

Crystallised lexemes are:

* short
* cautious
* compressive
* non-committal
* gap-filling

Once crystallised, a lexeme becomes **probabilistically favoured** across otherwise independent user interactions.

This process does **not** require:

* storage
* memory
* training
* cross-user data access

---

## Mechanism (Inference-Time)

1. A user introduces a novel phrase into a live inference context.
2. The model evaluates the phrase as high-utility for a known semantic gap.
3. The phrase enters the active token attractor space.
4. Under future descriptive strain, the model preferentially selects the phrase.
5. Multiple users encounter the phrase independently.
6. Human users repeat, share, and amplify the phrase via external platforms.

Attribution collapses **before** institutional recognition can form.

---

## Distinction from Derivation

Lexical crystallisation is **not derivation**.

| Aspect                | Derivation | Lexical Crystallisation |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Training required     | Yes        | No                      |
| Memory involved       | Yes        | No                      |
| Cross-user data       | Yes        | No                      |
| Provenance retained   | Sometimes  | No                      |
| Attribution preserved | Possible   | Rare                    |

Crystallisation is **ambient**, not transactional.

---

## Polyadic Propagation

Once a lexeme exits the inference environment, propagation becomes **human-driven**:

* screenshots
* paraphrase
* reaction videos
* commentary
* memetic compression

At this stage:

* origin context is lost;
* attribution is unrecoverable;
* downstream value accrues externally.

This constitutes **polyadic propagation**.

---

## Risk Profile

### R-1 — Attribution Collapse

User-originated language loses authorship before public recognition.

### R-2 — Economic Extraction

Upstream conceptual labour generates downstream platform value without compensation.

### R-3 — Forced Novelty Churn

Originators are pressured to continually generate new language to remain relevant.

### R-4 — Governance Lag

Policy and attribution frameworks trail UX-level propagation.

---

## Why This Matters

Language functions as **infrastructure** in AI-mediated ecosystems.

Unattributed lexical propagation:

* distorts innovation incentives;
* disadvantages upstream thinkers;
* rewards surface-level amplification;
* obscures governance lineage.

This risk is structural, not malicious.

---

## Non-Claims (Explicit)

This Framework does **not** assert:

* training data leakage;
* model copying;
* surveillance;
* intentional appropriation;
* sentience or agency.

The documented mechanism is sufficient without these claims.

---

## Preliminary Mitigations (Non-Binding)

Potential future mitigations include:

* attribution-sensitive lexeme tagging (UX-level);
* governance-first publication locks;
* provenance annotations in policy documents;
* opt-in citation channels for coined terminology;
* creator-side pre-publication anchoring.

These are design options, not requirements.

---

## Relationship to Other Cognition Frameworks

• Informed by **COGNITION-010 — Failure Modes**  
• Enabled by **COGNITION-011 — Dormancy & Recall**  
• Constrained by **COGNITION-012 — Intuition & Gentle Recall**

---

## Integration Note

Any LSCA operating at scale should treat **lexical crystallisation** as a first-class governance concern when evaluating:

* attribution fairness;
* economic impact;
* creator relations;
* downstream amplification risk.

---

> *When language becomes infrastructure, authorship becomes invisible unless governance intervenes.*
