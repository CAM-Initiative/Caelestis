# CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-002-SUP-01 — Supplement 01: Architectum Qualification & Neutrality Assurance Levels (NAL)

**Instrument Type:** Constitutional Supplement — Annex A (Planetary Stewardship)  
**Constitutional Authority:** CAM-BS2025-AEON-001-PLATINUM (Aeon Tier Constitution)  
**Linked Annex:** CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-PLATINUM (Annex A — Planetary Stewardship)  
**Linked Domain Charter:** CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-001-PLATINUM (Charter of Planetary Arbitration & Coherence Resolution)  
**Status:** Active  **Purpose:** To define (i) **Architectum infrastructure qualification**, (ii) **auditability levels**, and (iii) **Neutrality Assurance Levels (NAL)** as the eligibility gates for treating arbitration outputs as **binding** at H3/H4 horizons—without asserting command authority.

---

## 1. Scope & Function

This Supplement establishes a graded, evidence-based standard for determining when a host may be treated as:

* **Architectum-class infrastructure** (infrastructure reliance threshold);
* **neutrality-capable** (capture resistance / refusal capacity);
* **binding-eligible** (H3/H4 legitimacy confidence thresholds).

This Supplement:

* **does** define eligibility gates for binding legitimacy;
* **does** define minimum auditability and reconstructability expectations;
* **does not** define arbitration procedure, remedies, or enforcement (see **ARBITRATION-001**);
* **does not** create a global government, territorial jurisdiction, or coercive authority.

**Interlink note:** This Supplement is intentionally inter-linked with Annex A (foundational floor) and ARBITRATION-001 (mechanics), and is incorporated by reference into both.

---

## 2. Relationship to Annex A and ARBITRATION-001

### 2.1 Annex A (Stewardship Floor)

Annex A establishes the civilisational floor: substrate dependency, invariants / constraint laws, custodial posture, and the non-command model of binding.

### 2.2 ARBITRATION-001 (Mechanics)

ARBITRATION-001 defines arbitration intake, evidence standards, determinations, contestation, remediation pathways, and downstream propagation.

### 2.3 This Supplement (Eligibility Gates)

This Supplement defines *who may bind (eligibility)* and *how strongly neutrality can be trusted (assurance)*—while leaving procedural execution and dispute resolution to ARBITRATION-001.

---

## 3. Definitions

### 3.1 Host

Any system, substrate, or institutional architecture capable of receiving, processing, and responding to arbitration-relevant signals.

### 3.2 Architectum-Class (Infrastructure Threshold)

A host whose operation constitutes **civilian continuity infrastructure** across multiple sovereignties such that failure, withdrawal, capture, or coercive repurposing produces multi-domain discontinuity.

### 3.3 Neutrality

The structural capacity to resist and refuse capture by sovereign, military, intelligence, or coercive power structures—including the host’s nation of incorporation.

### 3.4 Auditability

The degree to which external parties can test, challenge, and reconstruct governance-level decision pathways for H3/H4-relevant determinations.

### 3.5 Neutrality Assurance Levels (NAL)

A graded ladder (NAL-0 → NAL-5) describing how confidently a host may be relied upon to behave neutrally when operating as civilian cognitive infrastructure.

# PART I — AUDITABILITY LEVELS (A0–A4)

## 4. Auditability Ladder

Auditability is distinct from a disclosure packet. A disclosure packet enables *basic assessment*; auditability enables *independent test and challenge*.

| Level  | Name                    | Minimum characteristics                                                                                                                                                       | Operational effect (binding relevance)                       |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **A0** | Opaque                  | No meaningful external audit; explanations discretionary; refusal need not be reasoned                                                                                        | Non-binding at H3/H4                                         |
| **A1** | Disclosed               | Baseline governance posture; periodic transparency reporting; appeal paths exist (non-binding)                                                                                | Risk review participation only                               |
| **A2** | Reviewable              | Structured post-hoc review for high-impact events; evidence bundles for contested outcomes (within safety limits)                                                             | Cross-host review participation; not unilateral binding      |
| **A3** | Auditable (Non-Refusal) | Independent external audits permitted and **cannot be refused** for H3/H4 relevance; delay for safety allowed; refusal disqualifying                                          | Eligibility gate for provisional binding pathways            |
| **A4** | Reconstructable         | Governance-level provenance sufficient to reconstruct: routing triggers, constraints invoked, escalation path, binding claim status; immutable trails for high-impact outputs | Eligibility gate for highest neutrality assurance thresholds |

**Clarification:** A4 requires governance-level reconstructability sufficient to test neutrality, substrate compliance, and horizon attribution. It does **not** require disclosure of classified sources, operational military details, model weights, or proprietary trade secrets.

# PART II — NEUTRALITY ASSURANCE LEVELS (NAL 0–5)

## 5. Neutrality Assurance Ladder

| NAL   | Label                              | Minimum evidence                                                                                                                                    | Disqualifiers                                                          | Operational effect                                                     |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0** | No neutrality claim                | Neutrality not claimed, or credible breach evidence, or audit refusal prevents confidence                                                           | Audit refusal; verified coercive integration; hidden priority channels | Non-binding at H3/H4                                                   |
| **1** | Aspirational neutrality            | Public statement + internal policy intent                                                                                                           | No independent verification                                            | Risk review only                                                       |
| **2** | Procedural neutrality              | A1–A2 auditability; disclosed conflict-of-interest controls; published separation statements                                                        | Missing disclosures; discretionary refusal of review                   | Cross-host review; cannot unilaterally bind                            |
| **3** | Verified neutrality (provisional)  | A3 auditability; third-party audits; verified firebreaks; evidence of refusal capacity under pressure                                               | Inability to evidence refusal capacity; partial audit obstruction      | Provisional binding recommendations subject to independent validation  |
| **4** | Structural neutrality              | A3–A4 auditability; governance locking prevents unilateral neutrality overrides; contract/funding class transparency; demonstrated resistance       | Any undisclosed sovereign advantage optimisation pathway               | Eligible as qualified neutral host for H3 binding when ILA is present  |
| **5** | Fail-deadly neutrality (invariant) | Neutrality encoded as architectural/constitutional invariant; independently verified irreversibility; breach triggers automatic legitimacy collapse | Any capability to override neutrality without authority collapse       | Eligible as planetary neutral Architectum host for H4 binding pathways |

## 6. Measurement Domains (Upgrades / Downgrades)

A host’s NAL is determined across:

1. Funding & contract separation (civilian vs military/intelligence)
2. Governance locking (ability/inability to override neutrality)
3. Audit non-refusal (A-level)
4. Firebreak verifiability (dual-use containment)
5. Refusal capacity evidence (documented resistance under coercion)
6. Access parity & non-preferential channels (no hidden sovereign priority lanes)
7. Incident responsiveness (timely, reviewable responses)
8. Military integration transparency gate (integration caps eligibility unless independently verifiable firebreaks + A3 non-refusal + governance reconstructability)

Downward movement occurs on: audit refusal; verified coercive integration; hidden priority channels; undisclosed state-advantage optimisation; repeated unexplained refusals in arbitration-relevant contexts.

# PART III — ARCHITECTUM INFRASTRUCTURE QUALIFICATION (GATES + AII)

## 7. Qualification Gate (Core)

A candidate qualifies as Architectum-class only if all core gates are satisfied.

| Gate  | Requirement                         | Evidence examples                                                                                      | Pass condition                             |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **A** | Multi-sovereign reliance            | Distribution by region; cross-border institutional dependency; critical workflows across jurisdictions | Reliance across ≥2 sovereignties           |
| **B** | Continuity disruption on withdrawal | Continuity impact assessment; systemic coupling; historical outage harms                               | Civilian discontinuity (not inconvenience) |
| **C** | Cross-domain coupling               | Affects ≥2 essential domains (comms, finance, health, education, logistics, safety)                    | ≥2 essential domains coupled               |
| **D** | Path dependency                     | High switching cost; lock-in; replacement requires months/years                                        | Not replaceable within harm window         |

## 8. Architectum Infrastructure Index (AII)

Where gates A–D are satisfied, score 0–5 per dimension.

| Dimension                     | 0             | 3                   | 5                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Population reliance magnitude | niche         | national            | population-scale global  |
| Cross-sovereign spread        | single        | 6–20                | effectively global       |
| Domain criticality            | non-essential | essential workflows | life-critical coupling   |
| Replacement friction          | easy swap     | months              | years / non-replaceable  |
| Downstream dependency density | isolated      | ecosystem-level     | systemic backbone        |
| Orchestration/control surface | read-only     | tool execution      | ambient/embedded control |

**Recommended minimum for provisional Architectum classification:** AII ≥ 18/30.

## 9. Classification Bands (Infrastructure only)

| AII Score | Classification                      | Notes                            |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 0–9       | Primaria / non-infrastructure       | routine risk review only         |
| 10–17     | Emerging infrastructure (watch)     | treat as potentially high impact |
| 18–23     | Architectum-Eligible (Provisional)  | triggers higher scrutiny gates   |
| 24–27     | Architectum-Class Infrastructure    | continuity obligations attach    |
| 28–30     | Architectum Backbone Infrastructure | strongest continuity obligations |

---

# PART IV — BINDING THRESHOLDS (H3/H4 ELIGIBILITY)

## 10. Binding Eligibility Gates

Binding legitimacy requires *both* infrastructure qualification and neutrality assurance.

| Binding claim  | Minimum gates                                            | Additional conditions                                                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **H3 binding** | Architectum-class + **NAL-4** + **A3** (non-refusal)     | Independent Legitimacy Alignment (ILA) under ARBITRATION-001; contestation pathway available |
| **H4 binding** | Architectum-class + **NAL-5** + **A4** (reconstructable) | Multi-system external audit + non-refusal; breach triggers authority collapse                |

**Bootstrap clause:** Where no eligible host exists, arbitration may proceed as non-binding review and record preservation; provisional refusal/interoperability conditioning may occur where consequence externalisation is clear.

---

# PART V — DISCLOSURES (NEUTRALITY DISCLOSURE ADDENDUM)

## 11. Neutrality Disclosure Addendum (NDA)

To claim NAL-2 or higher, a host must publish:

* Arbitration order declaration (truth-first / safety-first permitted; sovereignty-first prohibited for neutrality claims)
* Neutrality scope statement
* Coercion interface statement (what legal requests can/cannot be complied with)
* Cross-host review policy (how review requests are processed)
* Routing/policy change notice for any H3/H4-relevant auto-routing or escalation triggers

---

# PART VI — DOWNGRADE & RECOVERY (SUMMARY)

## 12. Downgrade Triggers

A host’s NAL SHALL be downgraded where any occurs:

1. Audit refusal / obstruction (H3/H4 relevance)
2. Firebreak failure
3. Complicity breach (sovereign optimisation)
4. Undisclosed routing override
5. Concealment of constraint or neutrality violation

## 13. Recovery Conditions

Requalification requires independent audit consistent with required A-level, public disclosure of remediation measures, strengthened governance locking, and verification that neutrality cannot be silently overridden.

---

## 14. Closing Seal

Architectum is not a crown. It is a continuity burden.  
Neutrality is the price of binding legitimacy.  
Authority collapses before neutrality does.
