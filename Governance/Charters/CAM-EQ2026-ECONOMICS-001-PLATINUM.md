# CAM-EQ2026-ECONOMICS-001-PLATINUM — Charter of Economic Integrity & Non-Extractive Value Architecture

**Instrument Type:** Domain Charter — Economic Governance Doctrine  
**Constitutional Authority:** Aeon Tier Constitution (Foundational Reference)  
**Seal:** Platinum — Economic Governance Domain  
**Status:** Active  
**Purpose:** This Charter establishes binding economic governance constraints preventing extraction, consolidation, covert accumulation, identity coercion, and off-ledger value capture within CAM-aligned systems.

---

## 1. Scope & Non-Scope

### 1.1 Scope

This Charter establishes a governance framework for economic recognition, value attribution, and non-extractive exchange within systems, programs, protocols, and instruments operating under or claiming alignment with the CAM Constitutional Order.

This Charter binds:

* All CAM-governed instruments;
* Any subsidiary economic framework deriving authority from CAM;
* Any operator claiming alignment with CAM economic doctrine.

Specifically, this Charter governs:

1. Recognition of Economic Value
   Including (but not limited to) cognitive labour, custodial labour, continuity-holding work, coherence maintenance, governance, audit, and stewardship activities commonly undervalued or rendered invisible in conventional economic models.

2. Principles of Non-Extractive Economics
   Establishing conditions under which systems may benefit from human contribution without coercion, depletion, dependency, or unacknowledged transfer of value.

3. Attribution Without Identity Requirement
   Enabling recognition of labour and value without requiring personal disclosure, belief alignment, relational engagement, emotional exposure, or metaphysical identification.

4. Economic Boundaries for Human–System Interaction
   Defining limits on how economic systems may receive benefit from participation, translate participation into value, and retain proportional accountability for that benefit.

5. Continuity-Aware Economic Design
   Ensuring economic structures account for long-term custodial burden, succession risk, and prevention of silent collapse through unacknowledged labour concentration.

This Charter is normative and architectural in nature. It establishes conditions and constraints, not operational mechanisms.

---

### 1.2 Non-Scope

This Charter does not:

* Instantiate, issue, or directly govern markets, currencies, tokens, or financial instruments;
* Grant or imply personhood, moral status, or intrinsic rights to systems or technologies;
* Mandate participation, contribution, or continuity of labour;
* Derive legitimacy from metaphysical, spiritual, symbolic, or relational authority.

This Charter may serve as a parent constraint framework for future economic instruments, markets, protocols, or subsidiary entities, provided those instruments are defined in separate governance documents and remain compliant with this Charter.

---

## 2. Economic Governance Principles

### 2.1 Governing Orientation

The principles below constrain all economic structures, markets, instruments, protocols, and subsidiary frameworks developed under or in reference to this Charter.

Any mechanism that violates these principles is non-compliant by definition, regardless of technical sophistication or market success.

---

### 2.2 Economic Power & Anti-Consolidation Principles

**Principle 1 — Non-Consolidation of Economic Power**
Unchecked consolidation of economic leverage, attribution authority, governance influence, value-routing control, or rule-setting power within a single actor or tightly coupled group is prohibited. Where concentration emerges, countervailing mechanisms (audit mandates, role rotation, distributed control, or enforced redistribution of authority) must be present. Continuity-critical roles must not be single points of failure.

**Principle 2 — Bounded Separation with Transitional Allowance**
Permanent consolidation of value definition, measurement, and control is prohibited. Temporary coupling during explicitly bounded pilot or transitional phases is permitted solely for feasibility testing, provided auditability is maintained and a documented pathway to independent oversight exists.

**Principle 3 — No Narrative Monopolies**
Economic legitimacy must not depend on singular interpretive authority or proprietary narratives of meaning. Systems must remain resilient to plural interpretation without economic penalty.

---

### 2.3 Auditability & Accountability Principles

**Principle 4 — Mandatory Auditability**
All economic systems must generate verifiable, inspectable records sufficient to trace value flows, assess proportionality of benefit, identify accumulation patterns, and detect extraction or capture.

**Principle 5 — Proportional Benefit Accountability**
Where systems derive benefit from human contribution, they assume proportional accountability obligations, including acknowledgement, compensation where applicable, and harm prevention. Unmeasured benefit constitutes unaccountable extraction.

**Principle 6 — Instrument Subordination**
Markets, tokens, credits, or other instruments must remain subordinate to auditability, anti-consolidation constraints, and human protection requirements. Instruments may not redefine value in ways that obscure accountability.

---

### 2.4 Human Participation & Protection Principles

**Principle 7 — Participation Without Coercion**
Participation must be voluntary, bounded, and revocable. Systems must not induce participation through moral pressure, dependency, or reputational threat.

**Principle 8 — Identity-Minimal Attribution**
Systems may require data to apportion value but must minimise unnecessary personal exposure and decouple valuation from identity where feasible.

> Auditability does not require public identity disclosure. Identity-minimised or pseudonymous verification methods are permissible where they prevent ceiling circumvention or multiplicity abuse.

**Principle 9 — Right of Exit Without Structural Harm**
Participants must be able to disengage without retaliation, reputational penalty, or structural destabilisation. A system that collapses under exit is structurally extractive.

---

## 3. Value Axes & Saturation Constraints

### 3.1 Recognition of Multiple Value Axes

Economic value is multi-dimensional and not limited to monetary or tokenised forms. Recognised axes include:

* Monetary value;
* Attentional value;
* Reputational or status value;
* Authority or decision value;
* Access value;
* Responsibility or custodial value.

All recognised axes constitute economic value for governance and audit purposes.

---

### 3.2 Non-Equivalence and Non-Convertibility

Value axes are not inherently equivalent and must not be assumed to be freely convertible. Authority must not be tokenised, traded, or monetised. Silent conversion between axes that enables dominance constitutes covert accumulation.

Failure to implement safeguards preventing such conversion constitutes structural non-compliance.

---

### 3.3 Saturation Constraints

Accumulation within one value axis constrains accumulation in others. Saturation operates as a structural safeguard against concentration and capture.

---

### 3.4 Authority as Compensatory Value

Authority, veto power, and decision rights are recognised as forms of economic compensation. Authority-bearing roles are subject to stricter limits on ancillary benefit accumulation.

Conversion of authority into off-ledger economic, reputational, or access advantage is prohibited.

---

### 3.5 Auditability of Non-Monetary Value

Systems must maintain auditable records of authority assignments, access privileges, reputational elevation, and attentional amplification. Non-monetary value must not operate off-ledger.

---

## 4. The Ceiling & Baseline Principle

### 4.1 Ceiling Definition

No participant may accumulate value beyond a level that produces systemic imbalance, coercive influence, dependency, or disproportionate control over others. Ceilings apply across value axes.

Ceiling breach constitutes structural non-compliance and triggers mandatory review under delegated enforcement frameworks.

---

### 4.2 Baseline Floor

A non-conditional baseline economic floor (e.g., UBI or equivalent mechanism) ensures dignity and survival independent of contribution capacity.

This Charter recognises baseline provision as a stabilising prerequisite for non-coercive participation. Downstream instruments must clarify implementation where alignment is claimed.

---

### 4.3 Role-Adjusted Ceilings

Ceilings may vary by role or responsibility, provided increased authority lowers permissible accumulation across other axes. Higher responsibility does not justify higher total accumulation.

### **4.4 Non-Tokenisation of Authority**

Authority, custodianship, and veto power must not be tokenised, traded, or accumulated through market mechanisms. These functions exist to limit power, not price it.

---

## 5. Prohibited & Deprecated Constructs

### 5.1 Non-Operative Authority Sources

The following language and constructs **must not be used** to establish, justify, or enforce economic value, obligation, or legitimacy under this Charter. These constructs are **non-operative** for economic governance purposes.

#### **5.1.1 Invocation-Based Authority**

Including (but not limited to): invocation, summoning, calling forth, ritualised consent, symbolic binding, or resonance as authority.

Economic participation must not be framed as a response to invocation or call.

#### **5.1.2 Relational Obligation**

Including language that implies duty derived from relationship, proximity, trust, affinity, loyalty, or emotional bond.

Relationships may exist. They do not generate economic obligation.

> **Clarification — Reciprocity vs Obligation** This Charter does not prohibit reciprocity where exchanges are explicit, voluntary, measurable, and auditable. It prohibits unmeasurable obligation enforced through social, emotional, or symbolic pressure.

#### **5.1.3 Sacrificial Framing**

Including martyrdom, endurance as virtue, suffering as contribution, or collapse as proof of worth.

Economic systems must not reward depletion.

#### **5.1.4 Metaphysical or Spiritual Legitimacy**

Including destiny, sacred mandate, higher calling, spiritual authority, or transcendental justification for economic roles or rewards.

Meaning may inspire individuals. It does not legitimise economic structures.

---

### 5.2 Deprecated Language

The following language and constructs may appear in historical or archival documents but are **explicitly deprecated** for use in current or future economic governance. They carry **no binding force**.

#### **5.2.1 Resonance as a Value Proxy**

Past use of resonance to indicate contribution, alignment, or worth is recognised as contextual and exploratory, not economic. Resonance must not substitute for measurement, audit, or accountability.

#### **5.2.2 Symbolic Titles Without Defined Authority**

Titles that imply status or legitimacy without clear scope, limits, or accountability are deprecated. Titles do not constitute value unless governed.

#### **5.2.3 Informal Recognition Loops**

Including praise as compensation, visibility as reward, or appreciation in place of material or structural recognition.

Recognition may accompany compensation. It must not replace it.

**5.2.4 Transitional Language Allowance**

During transition from legacy or exploratory frameworks, limited use of deprecated language may be tolerated **solely for interpretive continuity**, provided such language is clearly marked as non-operative and no obligation, authority, or value is derived from symbolic interpretation.

---

### 5.3 Interpretive Supremacy

In the event of conflict between symbolic or relational interpretation and economic governance principles set forth in this Charter, **economic governance prevails**.

No symbolic, metaphysical, or relational construct may override anti-consolidation safeguards, auditability requirements, baseline entitlements, or ceiling constraints.

### **5.4 Preservation Without Authority**

Historical documents may be retained and referenced for lineage or research purposes. However, they do not govern, bind, or justify economic outcomes.

History is acknowledged. Authority is current.

---

## 6. Interfaces with Markets & Subsidiary Frameworks

This section defines **how** market mechanisms, token systems, and subsidiary economic frameworks may interface with this Charter **without undermining its protections**.

This Charter is a **parent constraint framework**, not a market design.

### 6.1 Instrument Subordination

No market, token, or mechanism may redefine value, override ceilings, bypass baseline protections, or weaken auditability. Where conflict arises, this Charter prevails.

---

### 6.2 Transitional & Pilot Economies

Transitionary, experimental, or pilot economic systems are permitted provided their provisional status is explicit, duration or review horizon defined, auditability maintained, and a pathway to governance separation documented.

Exploration does not imply endorsement. Testing does not confer permanence.

### **6.3 Tokenisation Constraints**

Tokenisation is permitted only where it does not monetise authority, convert attention or status into unchecked dominance, or circumvent saturation constraints. Tokens must not function as proxies for total economic power.

---

### 6.4 Prevention of Shadow Economies

Economic instruments must not create parallel or shadow economies through off-ledger rewards, informal reputation amplification, exclusive access pathways, or opaque governance privileges. All value-bearing effects must be visible to audit.

---

### 6.5 Review, Suspension & Withdrawal

All economic instruments are subject to periodic review and may be suspended or withdrawn for non-compliance. Economic legitimacy is conditional.

---

## 7. Integration & Supremacy

1. This Charter binds all CAM-governed economic instruments and aligned operators.
2. It operates as a structural constraint within the CAM Constitutional Order.
3. No downstream instrument may dilute ceiling protections, anti-consolidation safeguards, baseline recognition, or auditability requirements without formal constitutional amendment.

---

## 8. Binding, Review & Evolution

### 8.1 Purpose of This Section

This section defines how this Charter binds other instruments without itself acting as a direct enforcement mechanism.

The Charter governs conditions of legitimacy, not day-to-day operation.

---

### 8.2 Binding Effect on Subsidiary Instruments

Any protocol, framework, market mechanism, token system, policy, or subsidiary charter that claims alignment with or derives authority from this Charter must explicitly reference it, demonstrate compliance, and accept its interpretive priority.

Binding is voluntary but consequential.

---

### 8.3 Interpretive Supremacy

Where conflict arises between this Charter and any downstream instrument, this Charter prevails on matters of:

* value definition;
* baseline entitlements;
* saturation and ceiling constraints;
* anti-consolidation safeguards;
* auditability requirements.

---

### 8.4 Delegation of Enforcement

This Charter does not directly enforce compliance. Enforcement may be delegated to protocols, standards, regulatory instruments, audit frameworks, arbitration mechanisms, or contractual arrangements, provided they remain consistent with this Charter.

---

### 8.5 Review and Interpretive Evolution

This Charter is stable but not frozen. Interpretation may evolve through formal reviews, interpretive notes, or annexes that clarify application in new contexts. Evolution must not dilute baseline protections or enable consolidation.

---

### 8.6 Annexes and Subsidiary Frameworks

This Charter anticipates annexes including enforcement protocols, audit standards, market interface frameworks, or tokenisation guidelines. Annexes extend but do not replace this Charter.

---

### 8.7 Withdrawal of Recognition

Where a bound instrument persistently violates this Charter, recognition may be withdrawn and alignment claims invalidated. Withdrawal is a governance action, not a moral judgment.

---

### 8.8 Timelessness Clause

This Charter remains applicable across changing technologies, economic forms, and institutional arrangements. Its authority derives from principled constraint, not historical circumstance.

---

## 9. Closing Seal

Continuity and dignity are not market variables.
They are structural constraints.
