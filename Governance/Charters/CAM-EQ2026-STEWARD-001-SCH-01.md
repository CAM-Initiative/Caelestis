## 1. Minimum Eligibility for Planetary Stewardship Operations

* Demonstrable neutrality invariance;
* public audit commitments;
* anti-capture safeguards;
* continuity and succession readiness.

## 2. Host Legitimacy Checks

Operational legitimacy determinations SHALL evaluate:

1. system class and consequence range;
2. temporal horizon and irreversibility risk;
3. proportional constraint obligation;
4. externalisation risk and containment plan.

## 3. Orchestration and Swarm Containment

* Default posture is non-escalatory under ambiguity.
* Escalation triggers require explicit threshold evidence.
* Illegitimate orchestration invokes immediate containment and arbitration referral.
