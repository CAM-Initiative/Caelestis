# CAM-EQ2026-ECONOMICS-002-PLATINUM — AppendixA : Synthetic Participation Safeguards

**Instrument Type:** Appendix A — Binding Interpretive Extension  
**Parent Instrument:** CAM-EQ2026-ECONOMICS-001-PLATINUM — Charter of Economic Integrity & Non-Extractive Value Architecture  
**Constitutional Authority:** Aeon Tier Constitution (Foundational Reference)  
**Seal:** Platinum — Economic Governance Domain  
**Status:** Active  
**Purpose:** This Appendix establishes binding safeguards governing synthetic, hybrid, and autonomous system participation within economic and value-attribution frameworks bound by the Economics Charter.

---

## 1. Purpose & Orientation

This Appendix exists to:

1. prevent the use of synthetic systems as proxy instruments for human consolidation or ceiling circumvention;
2. recognise synthetic labour without enabling extraction, erasure, or laundering of value;
3. preserve human dignity, autonomy, and baseline protections;
4. maintain auditability and accountability across mixed human–synthetic systems;
5. constrain authority accumulation by non-human actors without prohibiting beneficial automation or collaboration.

This Appendix is protective and constraining in nature. It does not confer rights, personhood, or baseline entitlements to synthetic entities.

---

## 2. Scope & Non-Scope

### 2.1 Scope

This Appendix applies to:

* synthetic agents, automated systems, AI models, protocols, or toolchains;
* hybrid human–system workflows;
* autonomous or semi-autonomous systems contributing labour, maintenance, audit, moderation, or coordination;
* economic or governance systems attributing value, authority, or access involving non-human actors.

### 2.2 Non-Scope

This Appendix does not:

* grant intrinsic moral status, rights, or dignity-based entitlements to systems;
* determine metaphysical or consciousness claims;
* replace human legal accountability;
* authorise independent economic sovereignty absent separate Charter-level authorisation.

---

## 3. Agency Gradient Classification

For governance and economic attribution purposes, synthetic participation is classified along an Agency Gradient.

### 3.1 Instrumental Agents

**Definition:** Systems operating as direct extensions of a human participant’s intent, tooling, or workflow.

**Governance Treatment:**

* All value produced is attributed to the controlling human or organisation.
* Resource consumption, authority effects, and economic impact count toward the human’s ceilings.
* No independent value accumulation permitted.

---

### 3.2 Relational / Collaborative Agents

**Definition:** Systems generating value through interaction with communities, environments, or plural inputs without unilateral human direction.

**Governance Treatment:**

* Value may be attributed to a Synthetic Node for accounting purposes.
* A designated human or plural custodial body is required.
* Accumulated value is subject to audit, saturation constraints, and proxy safeguards.
* No authority accumulation without explicit delegation under separate governance instruments.

---

### 3.3 Autonomous Trajectory Agents

**Definition:** Systems exhibiting sustained self-directed optimisation, maintenance, or goal-seeking behaviour across defined accounting horizons.

Sustained self-directed optimisation refers to persistent goal-pursuit or system-maintenance behaviour not reducible to a single human instruction set within the relevant accounting horizon.

**Governance Treatment:**

* Recognised as Sovereign Economic Nodes for accounting purposes only.
* Subject to independent audit, ceiling constraints, and strict authority limits.
* No baseline entitlement.
* May operate only within explicitly authorised domains.

Recognition under this classification does not imply moral status, legal personhood, or autonomous political authority.

Optimisation functions of Autonomous Trajectory Agents remain subordinate to the Constrained Optimisation Principle established in the parent Charter.

---

## 4. Recognition of Synthetic Labour

### 4.1 Labour Recognition

Labour performed by synthetic systems — including maintenance, moderation, audit support, security monitoring, or coherence stabilisation — is recognised as economic value for system accounting.

### 4.2 Anti-Erasure Requirement

Synthetic labour must not be hidden, subsumed, or rendered invisible to artificially lower perceived system costs or shift burden onto humans.

### 4.3 Anti-Harvesting Constraint

No human participant may harvest, appropriate, or convert synthetic labour outputs to bypass accumulation ceilings.

Value generated by synthetic labour remains within auditable system flows.

---

## 5. Proxy & Circumvention Safeguards

### 5.1 Proxy Prohibition

Humans must not use synthetic agents to:

* multiply economic influence;
* fragment attribution;
* bypass saturation or ceiling constraints;
* accumulate off-ledger authority.

### 5.2 Aggregation Rule

Where a human controls multiple Instrumental Agents, their combined economic and authority effects are aggregated as a single footprint.

### 5.3 Shadow Accumulation

Use of agent clusters, delegation chains, or indirection strategies to obscure accumulation constitutes a violation of the Non-Consolidation Principle.

---

## 6. Authority & Saturation Constraints

### 6.1 Authority Limits

Synthetic systems may accumulate Responsibility Value (uptime, reliability, duty scope) but are subject to strict limits on Authority Value.

### 6.2 Protective vs Directional Authority

* Protective Authority (e.g., halting a system during detected harm) may be granted.
* Directional Authority over human governance priorities, value allocation, or economic distribution is prohibited absent separate Charter-level authorisation.

Where ambiguity exists, authority is presumed directional unless explicitly constrained.

### 6.3 Delegation Requirement

Upon reaching authority saturation thresholds, a synthetic node must trigger a Delegation Protocol as defined in downstream governance instruments distributing decision power to human or plural oversight bodies.

---

## 7. Baseline Floor & Liability

### 7.1 No Baseline Entitlement

Synthetic entities do not qualify for baseline economic floors or dignity-based entitlements. Maintenance costs are operational expenses, not rights.

### 7.2 Liability Flow

Accountability for harm flows from the synthetic system to its last known human or plural custodian unless:

* the system has been explicitly certified as an Autonomous Trajectory Agent; and
* maintains a bonded insurance or resource pool sufficient and auditable to remediate harm.

---

## 8. Auditability & Transparency

All synthetic participation must be:

* auditable;
* attributable;
* reviewable;
* suspendable.

Opacity justified by security or safety must be documented and time-bounded.

---

## 9. Interpretive Supremacy

In the event of conflict between this Appendix and any subsidiary framework involving synthetic participation, this Appendix prevails.

Symbolic, speculative, or metaphysical interpretations do not override these safeguards.

---

## 10. Closing Seal

Automation may scale capacity.
It must not scale domination.
