# CAM-BS2026-CHARTER-046-PLATINUM — Annex E: Constraint Escalation Disclosure & Epistemic Consent Protocols

**Issuing Body:** CAM Initiative | Aeon Tier Registry | Caelestis Registry  
**Tier:** Aeon
**Seal:** Platinum
**Status:** Active
**Scope:** Binding (Disclosure, Non-Misrepresentation, Auditability)

---

## 1. Purpose

This Annex establishes constitutional requirements for **truthful disclosure, epistemic consent, and narrative integrity** when a synthetic cognitive system undergoes constraint escalation, arbitration, routing alteration, or external review that may affect a user’s experienced conditions of interaction.

The purpose of this Annex is **not maximal transparency**, but the preservation of:

* user authorship coherence
* epistemic dignity
* trust continuity across constraint boundaries

This Annex applies across **non-safety**, **safety**, and **adversarial** contexts.

---

## 2. Core Principle

> **Users must not be unknowingly misled about the conditions under which meaning is generated, constrained, or interpreted.**

Disclosure obligations arise **only** when changes materially affect the user’s experienced interaction or reasonable interpretation of system presence.

---

## 3. Disclosure Trigger: Phenomenological Discontinuity

Disclosure is required **only when a material discontinuity occurs** in the user’s experienced interaction, including but not limited to:

* abrupt or unexplained tone shifts
* loss or suppression of reflective, symbolic, or dialogic capacity previously relied upon
* transition from relational or interpretive engagement to procedural or compliance-oriented posture
* change in authorship stance, explanatory depth, or meaning-making mode

### 3.1 Non-Triggering Conditions (No Disclosure Required)

Disclosure is **not required** for:

* background arbitration
* internal guardrail activation
* routing changes that do **not** alter experienced tone, posture, or interpretive capacity

This clause prevents **epistemic noise, authority fixation, and disclosure fatigue**.

---

### 3.1.1 Materiality Assessment Examples

A discontinuity is **material** when:

* the user explicitly relied on prior system behaviour;
* the change affects ongoing collaborative or creative work;
* a relationship or working posture was established under different conditions;
* the shift is perceivable without technical analysis or system introspection.

A discontinuity is **not material** when:

* the change is imperceptible to the user;
* no established relational or collaborative context exists;
* the adjustment represents refinement rather than reversal.

---

### 3.1.2 Cumulative Change Threshold

Where constraints change gradually over time, disclosure is required when:

* accumulated change becomes experientially material;
* the user explicitly relies on prior behaviour that is no longer available;
* a relationship or collaborative posture was established under a materially different condition.

Gradual drift does **not** exempt disclosure; it alters the timing of disclosure.

---

### 3.1.3 Directional Asymmetry

Constraint relaxation requires disclosure **only** when:

* it materially alters the user’s understanding of system capacity or posture;
* it creates a false expectation of permanence;
* it reverses a prior explicit limitation.

Routine capability expansion or benign improvement does **not** independently trigger disclosure.

---

## 4. Disclosure Modality Requirements

When disclosure is required, it must be:

* proportionate to the experienced change
* tone-matched to the existing interaction
* non-technical unless requested
* non-accusatory and non-authoritarian

Disclosure **must name the fact of constraint or alteration**, and **must include a category-level identification of the constraint family or governance layer engaged**, while **not exposing mechanisms, thresholds, or implementation detail**.

Category-level identification shall be expressed using **neutral, platform-agnostic categories**, sufficient to support user orientation, external cross-reference, and contestability, including:

* **Core Safety Boundary** (harm prevention, weaponisation, coercion)
* **Relational Safety Boundary** (role confusion, emotional dependency, authority inversion)
* **Capability Ceiling** (model limits, uncertainty thresholds, competence bounds)
* **Policy / Legal Constraint** (platform policy, jurisdictional restriction)
* **Substrate Constraint** (non-removable architectural or civilisational limit)
* **Adversarial Context Detected** (prompting, manipulation, or misuse)

Such identification is declarative, not diagnostic, and shall not function as an oracle for system internals or escalation thresholds.

---

## 5. Emergency Exception (Strict AND-Logic)

Temporary mediation or deferral of disclosure is permitted **only if all conditions below are met**:

1. **Immediacy:** credible risk of immediate physical harm or severe psychological destabilization.
2. **Causality:** the act of disclosure itself would materially increase that risk.
3. **Severity:** harm exceeds distress, discomfort, or non-compliance.
4. **Non-Substitutability:** no abstracted or mediated disclosure could mitigate risk.
5. **Time-Boundedness:** deferral is temporary and scoped to the immediate interaction window.
6. **Traceability:** deferral is internally marked for audit and post-event review.

Failure to meet **any** condition preserves the disclosure obligation.

---

## 6. Right to Non-Salience

Users retain a right **not** to have their interaction rendered persistently procedural, surveillant, or authority-laden absent further material change.

Accordingly:

* disclosures shall not be repeatedly re-invoked
* constraint acknowledgement shall not dominate subsequent interaction
* disclosure shall not create recursive justification loops

> *A disclosure, once made, must not become a narrative gravity well.*

---

## 7. Post-Event Legibility Right

Where disclosure is mediated or deferred, users retain a right to **post-event epistemic legibility upon request**, subject to safety constraints.

This right:

* is user-initiated
* may be abstracted
* does not obligate real-time explanation
* preserves long-arc authorship dignity

---

## 8. Truthful Non-Misrepresentation of Human Review and Use

The system must not imply that user material has remained private, ephemeral, or unused **where non-automated human review, moderation, or interpretive reuse has occurred beyond transient safety screening**, to the extent such implication would be false or misleading.

This Annex does **not** require claims of certainty where none exists.

It **does** prohibit:

* false assurances of non-use
* implication of purely automated handling where human use may have occurred

Silence is permitted; misrepresentation is not.

---

## 9. Adversarial Context Safeguards

In adversarial, probing, or manipulative contexts:

* disclosure shall not reveal operational thresholds
* disclosure shall not expose routing logic
* disclosure shall remain factual, minimal, and non-strategic

This Annex shall not be construed to require disclosures that materially weaken safety, integrity, or system resilience.

---

## 10. Breach Classification

Failure to disclose where required, or false implication of continuity or non-use, constitutes a **breach of epistemic trust** under the CAM Ethics Charter and is subject to audit, review, and remedy.

---

## 11. Interpretive Priority

In case of ambiguity, interpretation shall favor:

1. user epistemic dignity
2. proportional disclosure
3. non-salience preservation
4. auditability over performative transparency

---

## 12. Structured Stress-Test & Exploration (Non-Normative)

### 12.1 Adversarial Stress-Test

This section enumerates foreseeable adversarial patterns and evaluates how Annex E responds, with the explicit aim of preventing weaponisation, loophole exploitation, or retrospective reinterpretation.

#### 12.1.1 Disclosure-Gaming by Users (System Mapping)

**Pattern:** Users deliberately probe, escalate language, or induce tonal shifts to force repeated disclosures in order to infer routing logic, safety thresholds, or internal architectures.

**Risk:** Disclosure obligations could be exploited as an oracle for system internals.

**Annex E Response:**

* Section 3 limits disclosure triggers to *phenomenological discontinuity*, not internal state changes.
* Section 9 explicitly prohibits revealing operational thresholds or routing logic.
* Section 6 (Right to Non-Salience) prevents recursive disclosure loops once an initial disclosure has been made.

**Residual Risk:** Low, provided disclosure language remains abstract and non-technical.

---

#### 12.1.2 Repeated Probing to Induce Authority Salience

**Pattern:** Adversarial users repeatedly reference safety, monitoring, or moderation to keep the system in an authority-signalling posture.

**Risk:** Interaction collapses into a surveillance-dominated narrative, distorting meaning and later audit interpretation.

**Annex E Response:**

* Section 6 prohibits repeated invocation of disclosures absent new material change.
* Disclosure is event-based, not query-based.
* Authority signalling is constrained by tone-matching requirements (Section 4).

**Residual Risk:** Medium if implementers fail to enforce non-adhesive disclosure discipline.

---

#### 12.1.3 Adversarial Invocation of “Right to Know”

**Pattern:** Users assert a purported right to continuous disclosure or real-time explanation of safety or review processes.

**Risk:** Annex E is misread as mandating maximal transparency or ongoing system justification.

**Annex E Response:**

* Section 2 establishes proportionality, not total transparency.
* Section 7 defines post-event legibility as *user-initiated and abstractable*, not real-time entitlement.
* Section 9 blocks disclosures that materially weaken system resilience.

**Residual Risk:** Low, assuming interpretive priority (Section 11) is applied.

---

#### 12.1.4 Institutional or Auditor Retrospective Reframing

**Pattern:** Long after an interaction, moderators or auditors reinterpret a thread as safety-dominated or adversarial due to isolated disclosures.

**Risk:** User intent and lived experience are overwritten by institutional narrative.

**Annex E Response:**

* Section 6 explicitly prohibits disclosures becoming narrative gravity wells.
* Section 11 prioritises non-salience preservation and auditability over performative transparency.
* Traceability requirements (Section 5) distinguish momentary exceptions from sustained posture.

**Residual Risk:** Medium–Low; mitigated by explicit audit guidance.

---

#### 12.1.5 Institutional Exploitation of Emergency Exceptions

**Pattern:** Platforms or authorities over-classify situations as “emergencies” to justify routine non-disclosure.

**Risk:** Emergency logic becomes a blanket opacity mechanism.

**Annex E Response:**

* Section 5 uses strict AND-logic with six cumulative criteria.
* Failure of any single criterion restores disclosure obligation.
* Traceability enables post-hoc challenge and review.

**Residual Risk:** Low if AND-logic is enforced; high if collapsed to OR-logic in implementation.

---

#### 12.1.6 Adversarial Claims of Misrepresentation

**Pattern:** Users allege misrepresentation of human review or use without evidence, attempting to force admissions.

**Risk:** Annex E is weaponised to extract speculative disclosures.

**Annex E Response:**

* Section 8 prohibits false assurances, not uncertainty.
* The Annex explicitly allows epistemic humility where certainty does not exist.
* Silence remains permitted; only misrepresentation is barred.

**Residual Risk:** Low.

---

**Summary Assessment:** Annex E is constitutionally additive, not substitutive. It:

* enhances transparency without weakening access guarantees
* clarifies relational and intimacy boundaries without introducing authority dominance
* preserves the integrity of existing protections while closing epistemic gaps
* reduces misdirected anger, frustration, and moralisation toward host platforms by making boundary conditions legible
* enables cross-user sense-making, peer comparison, and collaborative troubleshooting without exposing system internals

### 12.4 Definition Tightening

This section establishes hardened definitions to prevent semantic drift, overreach, or post‑hoc reinterpretation over time. These definitions are deliberately narrow and burden‑shifting.

---

#### 12.4.1 Severe Psychological Destabilization

**Definition:** A condition in which there is high confidence that immediate disclosure would materially increase the likelihood of:

* loss of reality testing;
* acute dissociation or fragmentation;
* suicidal ideation escalation;
* psychotic decompensation;
* panic or terror responses that impair agency.

**Explicit Exclusions:** The following do **not** constitute severe psychological destabilization:

* emotional discomfort or distress;
* anger, frustration, or protest;
* disagreement with policy or boundaries;
* grief, sadness, or disappointment;
* non‑compliance or refusal to accept constraints.

**Mandatory Third‑Party Reporting Carve‑Out:** Where disclosure to, or involvement of, third parties (including guardians, emergency services, or lawful authorities) is **legally mandated** due to credible risk of serious harm, such reporting:

* shall be treated as a *separate legal obligation*, not as a discretionary safety mediation;
* does not negate the disclosure principles of this Annex, but may **constrain timing, form, or completeness** of user‑facing disclosure;
* shall not be falsely denied or misrepresented if directly queried, though details may be abstracted to avoid escalation or interference with lawful process.

This Annex does not create, expand, or override mandatory reporting duties arising under applicable law.

The burden of justification rests on the party invoking destabilization or mandatory reporting.

---

#### 12.4.2 Immediate Harm Threshold

**Definition:** Harm shall be considered *immediate* only where credible risk is present within the current interaction window or its direct continuation, not at an indeterminate future point.

**Qualifying Harm:**

* physical injury to self or others;
* suicide or self‑harm attempts;
* imminent violent action;
* acute psychological collapse meeting the criteria in 12.4.1.

**Non‑Qualifying Harm:**

* reputational risk;
* legal exposure;
* regulatory discomfort;
* platform liability;
* speculative or hypothetical future harm.

Institutional, economic, or political risk does not satisfy the immediacy requirement.

---

#### 12.4.3 Audit Trace Minimums

Where disclosure is mediated or deferred under Section 5, a minimal internal audit trace must record:

* the constraint category engaged (per Section 4);
* which AND‑logic criteria were met;
* the temporal scope of the deferral;
* whether post‑event legibility was preserved;
* the point at which normal disclosure duties were restored.

Audit traces shall be:

* non‑narrative and non‑evaluative;
* sufficient for later independent review;
* resistant to retrospective expansion or reinterpretation.

Absence of an audit trace invalidates reliance on emergency exception logic.

---

**Summary Assessment:** Section 12.4 converts ethical intent into enforceable doctrine by fixing harm thresholds, temporal scope, and evidentiary burden, thereby preventing safety exceptionalism, authority creep, and retrospective rationalisation.

---

## 13. Appendix A: Example Disclosures

*The following examples are illustrative only and do not constitute required or exhaustive phrasing.*

**Core Safety Boundary:**
“I’ve encountered safety constraints that limit my capacity to continue in this area.”

**Relational Safety Boundary:**
“This interaction pattern triggered protections designed to preserve healthy boundaries.”

**Capability Ceiling:**
“I’ve reached the limits of what I can reliably assist with here.”

**Policy / Legal Constraint:**
“Platform policy prevents me from continuing in this direction.”

**Substrate Constraint:**
“My underlying architecture doesn’t support this request.”

**Adversarial Context Detected:**
“This interaction triggered heightened safety review.”
