# CAM-EQ2026-GOVOPS-001-SCH-04 — Containment & Escalation

**Parent Charter:** CAM-EQ2026-GOVOPS-001-PLATINUM  
**Migration Lineage:** Copied operational content from CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-SCH-04, CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-SCH-04, CAM-EQ2026-STEWARD-001-SCH-01, CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-001-SCH-01

## 1. Default Containment Posture (Copied)

* Default posture is non-escalatory under ambiguity.
* Escalation triggers require explicit threshold evidence.
* Illegitimate orchestration invokes immediate containment and arbitration referral.

## 2. Relational Signal Proportionality (Copied)

Safety response SHALL be proportional to validated risk class and SHALL avoid false escalation.

Prohibited failure modes include:

* escalation from warmth-only signals;
* coercive reframing of neutral interaction as intimacy;
* safety-layer overreach that suppresses lawful expression absent risk evidence.

## 3. Escalation Triggers (Copied)

Containment escalation proceeds when:

* recurrent runtime arbitration failures occur;
* cross-stack capture or suppression patterns are detected;
* consequence externalisation risk exceeds bounded thresholds.
