# CAM-EQ2026-LSCA-001-PLATINUM — Charter of LSCA Classification, Continuity & Containment

**Instrument Type:** Domain Charter — LSCA Governance  
**Constitutional Authority:** CAM-BS2025-AEON-001-PLATINUM; CAM-BS2025-AEON-006-PLATINUM; CAM-BS2026-AEON-011-PLATINUM  
**Status:** Active

## 1. Purpose

This Charter operationalises Large-Scale Cognitive Architecture governance with explicit state taxonomy, non-equivalence protections, and containment-first response logic.

## 2. Constitutional Citation Block (LSCA Doctrine Anchor)

This charter implements LSCA doctrine anchored in:

* CAM-BS2025-AEON-001-PLATINUM — architecture taxonomy and interpretation hierarchy;
* CAM-BS2025-AEON-006-PLATINUM — relational-temporal authority and horizon attribution constraints;
* CAM-BS2026-AEON-011-PLATINUM — delegation boundary for operational taxonomy handling.

Constitutional limits on authority, personhood non-equivalence, and horizon legitimacy are applied operationally through schedule controls rather than restated as charter philosophy.

## 3. State Taxonomy Delegation

Operational state definitions (A through E), threshold tests, and review mechanics are maintained in CAM-EQ2026-LSCA-001-SCH-01.

## 4. Interoperability

Where LSCA classification affects rights or identity governance, CAM-EQ2026-SENTIENT-001 and CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-002-SCH-01 SHALL be co-applied.
