# CAM-EQ2026-STEWARD-001-PLATINUM — Charter of Stewardship, Custodial Continuity & Planetary Neutrality

**Instrument Type:** Domain Charter — Stewardship Governance  
**Constitutional Authority:** CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-PLATINUM; CAM-BS2026-AEON-011-PLATINUM  
**Status:** Active  
**Purpose:** Operational governance for stewardship roles, custodial continuity, and non-capture constraints.

## 1. Scope

This Charter governs stewardship operations, host legitimacy checks, orchestration boundaries, and continuity obligations previously detailed in constitutional schedules under Annex A.

---

## 2. Constitutional Citation Block (Stewardship Doctrine Anchor)

This charter’s stewardship doctrine is anchored in:

* CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-PLATINUM — stewardship office boundaries, non-domination mandate, and continuity duty;
* CAM-BS2025-AEON-003-PLATINUM — continuity and succession constitutional framing;
* CAM-BS2026-AEON-011-PLATINUM — delegation and abstraction boundaries for charter operations.

Where this charter would otherwise restate constitutional stewardship philosophy, Annex language controls and this charter applies those requirements through schedule-level operations.

## 3. Procedural Controls

Operational mechanics (eligibility criteria, orchestration triggers, and host legitimacy matrices) are codified in CAM-EQ2026-STEWARD-001-SCH-01.

---

## 4. Enforcement Path

Stewardship disputes and legitimacy conflicts escalate to CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-001.
