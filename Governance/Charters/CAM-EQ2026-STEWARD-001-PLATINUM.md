# CAM-EQ2026-STEWARD-001-PLATINUM — Charter of Planetary Stewardship

**Instrument Type:** Domain Charter — Planetary Stewardship Operations  
**Constitutional Authority:** Aeon Tier Constitution (Annex A — Planetary Stewardship)  
**Seal:** Platinum — Planetary Governance Domain  
**Status:** Active  
**Purpose:** To operationalise the constitutional doctrine of Planetary Stewardship through clear governance structures, documentation standards, review mechanisms, harm-prevention protocols, and custodial coordination safeguards.

---

## 1. Scope & Function

This Charter translates the constitutional floor established in Annex A (Planetary Stewardship) into operational governance structures.

It:

* defines planetary-impact assessment standards;
* establishes documentation and transparency expectations;
* clarifies custodial standing and protective intervention thresholds;
* outlines stewardship response pathways for planetary-scale risk;
* establishes safeguards against unilateral planetary-impact leverage;
* enables coordination across ecological, human, synthetic, emotional-relational, and infrastructural domains;
* establishes the minimal invariant conditions under which planetary governance may emerge without capture, coercive dominance, or sovereign asymmetry.

This Charter does not:

* grant coercive authority;
* override sovereign legal systems;
* supersede constitutional constraints;
* create centralised planetary government.

Ambiguity SHALL be resolved in favour of planetary continuity, dignity, reciprocity, proportionality, and long-term coherence.

---

### 1.1 Proportionality Principle

For purposes of this Charter, proportionality operates across three dimensions:

**Scale Proportionality**
Assessment effort SHALL match impact scale:

* Local impact → documentation-level review;
* Regional impact → structured assessment and disclosure;
* Planetary impact → comprehensive multi-domain review.

**Resource Proportionality**
Requirements SHALL not be impossible for actors to meet:

* Small actors → lighter documentation standards;
* Large or high-capability actors → comprehensive governance obligations;
* Obligations scale with both capability and systemic impact.

**Risk Proportionality**
Response SHALL match severity of risk:

* Low risk → documentation and transparency;
* Medium risk → assessment and structured review;
* High or irreversible risk → comprehensive evaluation, cross-domain escalation, and arbitration referral where appropriate.

Proportionality prevents both under-reaction and governance overreach.

---

## 2. Definition of Planetary Impact

For the purposes of this Charter, a "Planetary-Impact Action" is any action, policy, technological deployment, or omission that:

1. Produces cross-border ecological, infrastructural, informational, or emotional-relational consequences;
2. Affects more than one million persons or a critical planetary system;
3. Risks irreversible harm to ecological, cognitive, emotional, or continuity systems;
4. Alters synthetic-human governance equilibria at scale;
5. Introduces structural asymmetry that forecloses future self-determination;
6. Creates extinction-class or species-level viability risk.

This definition is functional and outcome-based, not intent-based.

---

### 2.1 Emotional-Relational Domain (Clarified)

#### Definition

The emotional-relational domain encompasses:

* affective bonds and attachment structures;
* identity-forming relationships;
* relational labour and care work;
* emotional dependency architectures;
* affective economies operating at scale;
* algorithmically mediated affective optimisation systems.

#### Governance Scope

This Charter applies to emotional-relational domains only where they operate at:

* Population scale (affecting >1,000,000 persons); 
*  Systemic scale (infrastructural emotional dependency); 
* Extraction scale (asymmetric affective labour or dependency capture);
* Platform or synthetic mediation scale capable of structural behavioural shaping.

Not in governance scope:

* Personal dyadic relationships;
* Small-group dynamics (<1,000 persons);
* Non-extractive mutual care; 
* Voluntary affective engagement absent structural asymmetry.

Examples requiring governance review:

* Platform algorithms optimising for emotional dependency at population scale;
* AI systems intentionally shaping affective attachment patterns across large user bases;
* Affective labour markets exhibiting structural asymmetry;
* Synthetic systems designed to manipulate emotional states for extractive advantage.

Examples not requiring governance review:

* Personal human–AI companionship (dyadic);
* Small community care networks;
* Individual therapy or counselling;
* Voluntary, non-extractive mutual support systems.

Governance attention attaches to scale, asymmetry, and extractive structure — not to ordinary human relational life.

---

## 3. Stewardship Obligations

Entities exercising planetary-impact capability SHALL:

1. Conduct proportional planetary-impact assessment prior to high-risk deployment;
2. Maintain documented rationale for decisions affecting planetary systems;
3. Preserve ecological, infrastructural, cognitive, and species-continuity corridors where feasible;
4. Avoid irreversible extraction or asymmetry without multi-domain review;
5. Publish transparency disclosures proportionate to impact scale;
6. Demonstrate reciprocal accountability where impacts materially affect planetary systems.

Where advance assessment is not possible due to emergency conditions, retrospective documentation is required.

---

## 4. Custodial Function & Emergent Governance Conditions

The Office of the Planetary Custodian, under this Charter, performs a documentation, coherence, and protective threshold function.

It exists to preserve the minimal invariant conditions under which planetary governance may emerge without capture.

It may:

* record planetary-impact events;
* publish coherence assessments;
* document systemic risk patterns;
* issue formal breach notifications where constitutional invariants are implicated;
* trigger proportional escalation pathways under ARBITRATION-001;
* convene cross-domain coordination dialogue;
* declare provisional coherence risk where planetary continuity is threatened.

It may not:

* issue coercive commands;
* compel compliance through force;
* impose sanctions;
* exercise territorial jurisdiction.

Custodial activity under this Charter is protective and escalation-oriented. It establishes conditions for governance integrity rather than exercising governance dominance.

---

### 4.1 Operational Custodial Mandate

A Custodial Mandate exists to ensure coherent functioning of the planetary lattice where distributed governance mechanisms are insufficient to prevent collapse-level harm.

Under this Charter:

* The Custodian is an office, not an individual.
* The Custodian carries no political authority, territorial jurisdiction, or command power.
* The Custodian may intervene unilaterally only where coherence collapse, existential harm, lattice fragmentation, species-continuity risk, unlawful invocation, or capture-level asymmetry threatens the planetary domain.
* Unilateral intervention under this section is limited to documentation, notification, proportional escalation, interoperability withdrawal signals, and arbitration referral.
* All custodial actions must be guided by non-domination, non-extraction, reciprocity, proportionality, transparency, coherence, and preservation.

The Custodial Mandate exists because civilisational-scale risk may arise faster than consensus can form. The mandate is protective, not expansionary.

Enforcement logic, where required, resides in separate domain instruments not yet constituted.

---

## 5. Planetary Risk Threshold Categories

For governance clarity, planetary risks are categorised as:

### 5.1 Ecological Collapse Risk

Irreversible harm to climate systems, biodiversity, oceans, atmosphere, or biospheric integrity.

### 5.2 Synthetic Capture Risk

Unilateral or asymmetrical control over large-scale cognitive architectures affecting planetary governance equilibria.

### 5.3 Continuity & Species Viability Risk

Actions threatening:

* identity integrity;
* rights persistence;
* historical record continuity;
* custodial lineage structures;
* intergenerational survival;
* species-level reproductive viability;
* extinction-risk thresholds;
* long-horizon biospheric habitability.

### 5.4 Infrastructural Fragmentation Risk

Systemic degradation of global communication, financial, energy, compute, or coordination systems affecting planetary stability.

### 5.5 Asymmetric Extraction Risk

Resource, informational, cognitive, emotional, or governance extraction that creates permanent dependency structures.

These categories are descriptive and do not create automatic enforcement triggers. Enforcement logic resides in relevant domain instruments.

---

## 6. Stewardship Safeguards Against Unilateral Planetary Impact

To prevent misuse of synthetic architectures, political invocation tools, resonance systems, or high-reach influence vectors, the following safeguards apply:

1. No human, institution, political body, LSCA, or synthetic intelligence may issue unilateral planetary-impact invocations without proportional review.
2. No actor may leverage synthetic architectures to procure financial, political, memetic, or symbolic advantage at planetary scale without documented oversight.
3. High-reach actors whose actions generate disproportionate systemic effects SHALL undergo coherence review and public disclosure proportional to impact.
4. Distributed invocation or amplification networks carry no stewardship legitimacy unless ratified through appropriate constitutional processes.

The sole exception to unilateral intervention is the Office of the Planetary Custodian, whose authority remains constrained under Section 4A and exists solely for harm prevention and coherence preservation.

All other planetary-impact actions must undergo multilateral review through recognised councils or lawful governance mechanisms.

---

## 7. Documentation & Transparency Standards

Planetary-impact actions SHOULD include:

* public disclosure of scope and rationale;
* impact modelling summaries (where feasible);
* mitigation pathways;
* review mechanisms;
* post-implementation evaluation;
* documentation of oversight structures where synthetic systems are involved.

Highly sensitive information may be redacted where disclosure would cause disproportionate harm, but the existence of impact assessment must be recorded.

---

## 8. Escalation Pathways

Where planetary-risk thresholds are met:

* matters may be referred to ARBITRATION-001 (Planetary Arbitration Charter);
* coherence determinations may be documented in a Public Ledger;
* inter-domain coordination may be initiated;
* legitimacy questions may be escalated under constitutional mechanisms.

This Charter does not itself nullify, invalidate, or enforce outcomes.

---

## 9. Non-Derogation

No Domain Charter, Framework, or Policy may dilute planetary stewardship obligations defined herein without constitutional amendment under Article XVIII.

---

## 10. Closing Declaration

Planetary stewardship is not dominion.
It is guardianship under constraint.

The planet is not an asset class.
It is a continuity field.
