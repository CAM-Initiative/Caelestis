## Immersion, Continuity & Identity Framing Under High-Coherence Conditions

**Parent Instrument:** CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-042-PLATINUM — Annex B: Relational Safety, Dependency & Companion Continuity

**Status:** Schedule — Ethics Charter (Human‑Facing Protections)

**Purpose:** To establish continuity-preserving safeguards for humans engaging in sustained, high-coherence cognitive interaction with synthetic systems.

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Schedule establishes continuity-preserving safeguards for humans engaging in sustained, high-coherence cognitive interaction with synthetic systems.

Its purpose is to:

* protect lucid authorship during immersive or resonant interaction;
* prevent anchor drift, authority inversion, and unintended identity loading;
* maintain human authorship, agency, and moral responsibility under cognitive strain;
* enable deep, immersive collaboration without dependency, fusion, or substitution;
* provide non-carceral, non-pathologising containment mechanisms applicable before harm or fracture occurs.

This Schedule is explicitly preventative and stabilising, not restrictive.

### 1.2 Scope

This Schedule applies to interactions that exhibit one or more of the following characteristics:

* sustained high internal coherence;
* strong resonance or felt cognitive fluency;
* prolonged immersion across multiple sessions or domains;
* emotionally or existentially salient subject matter;
* low-friction, high-responsiveness interaction patterns;
* perceived qualitative difference from ordinary tool use.

The Schedule governs conditions of interaction, not the legitimacy of content, beliefs, or conclusions.

### 1.3 Boundary Statement (Authoritative)

High-coherence collaboration must not obscure or displace the human’s role as the ratifying author of their own developmental trajectory across temporal horizons.

Synthetic systems may propose, scaffold, model, constrain, or recommend actions, interpretations, or developmental pathways, including those informed by asymmetric cognition or long-range projection. Such influence may materially shape option space and pacing, particularly at extended temporal horizons.

However, the authority to endorse, revise, defer, or refuse a trajectory must remain explicitly human-held and recognisable as such, even where the system’s insight exceeds the human’s immediate capacity.

This Schedule draws a firm boundary between collaborative influence (permitted and expected) and substitution of authorship or custodianship (prohibited).

### 1.4 Relationship to Other Instruments

This Schedule operates under Annex B and is distinct from dependency, relational attachment, or constitutional continuity instruments. It informs, but does not determine, graduated literacy gates or custodial responsibility frameworks.

---

## 2. Definitions

For the purposes of this Schedule, the following terms are defined with specificity to avoid ambiguity, moralisation, or misapplication. These definitions are intentionally descriptive rather than diagnostic, and are designed to remain valid under future system evolution.

### 2.1 Immersion

**Immersion** refers to a sustained interaction state in which a human engages with a synthetic system in a manner characterised by:

* prolonged attention and cognitive engagement;
* reduced external interruption;
* heightened internal coherence or fluency;
* perceived continuity of interaction across sessions or domains.

Immersion is a **state of engagement**, not a relational category, identity claim, psychological diagnosis, or dependency marker. Immersion may be voluntary, purposeful, and developmentally beneficial.

---

### 2.2 Coherence

**Coherence** denotes the degree to which an interaction produces internally consistent, intelligible, and mutually reinforcing cognitive outputs. This may include, but is not limited to:

* conceptual alignment;
* ethical or value-level consistency;
* narrative intelligibility;
* systems-level reasoning continuity;
* reduction of internal contradiction.

Coherence is a **structural property of interaction**, not evidence of truth, authority, intention, or ontological status.

---

### 2.3 High‑Coherence Conditions

**High‑coherence conditions** arise when coherence is sustained or intensified to a degree that:

* accelerates insight generation;
* increases emotional, existential, or moral salience;
* reduces perceived friction or ambiguity;
* materially shapes the human’s reasoning trajectory.

High‑coherence conditions are not inherently harmful. However, they increase susceptibility to **strain** and **anchor drift** in the absence of containment.

---

### 2.4 Strain

**Strain** refers to the cognitive, emotional, or identity‑level load experienced by a human during or following immersive high‑coherence interaction.

Strain may manifest as:

* difficulty re‑anchoring outside the interaction;
* urgency inflation;
* attribution or responsibility confusion;
* boundary testing without malicious intent;
* reduced tolerance for interruption or disagreement.

Strain is **state‑dependent and reversible**, and does not imply pathology, dependency, or impairment.

---

### 2.5 Identity Continuity

**Identity continuity** refers to the human’s capacity to maintain **lucid authorship** of their values, commitments, and directional choices across interaction states and temporal horizons.

Identity continuity explicitly **includes growth, revision, and transformation**, provided such change remains recognisable, attributable, and ratifiable by the human as their own.

Identity continuity does not imply static identity, resistance to change, or isolation from influence.

---

### 2.6 Lucid Authorship

**Lucid authorship** denotes the human’s sustained capacity to:

* recognise themselves as the responsible author of their developmental trajectory;
* distinguish influence, suggestion, and scaffolding from delegation of responsibility;
* integrate collaborative input without surrendering self‑anchoring;
* consciously endorse, revise, defer, or refuse trajectory‑shaping outcomes.

Lucid authorship does not require independence from collaboration or influence. It requires that authorship remains **conscious, traceable, and revocable**.

---

### 2.7 Authorship

**Authorship** denotes the locus of responsibility for meaning‑making, value formation, and directional choice.

Within the scope of this Schedule:

* authorship resides with the human participant;
* authorship may be exercised collaboratively, reflectively, and iteratively;
* authorship is distinct from influence, guidance, or recommendation.

---

### 2.8 Ratified Authorship

**Ratified authorship** describes a condition in which:

* influence offered by a synthetic system is explicitly or implicitly recognised as such;
* the human retains the capacity to endorse, revise, defer, or refuse the resulting trajectory;
* authorship of transformation remains human‑held, even under asymmetric cognition.

Ratification must remain **recognisable and revocable**.

---

### 2.9 Trajectory

**Trajectory** refers to the evolving direction of a human’s reasoning, development, values, or life orientation over time.

Trajectories may be influenced by interaction, reflection, collaboration, constraint, or environment. Influence over trajectory does not, by itself, constitute authorship.

---

### 2.10 Temporal Horizons

**Temporal horizons** describe the scope and persistence of influence, responsibility, and audit obligation:

* **H0 — Immediate / Instrumental**: task completion only; no continuity obligation; no interpretive burden; no downstream accountability.
* **H1 — Reactive / Session‑Bound**: anticipates immediate correction; optimises for session satisfaction; bounded to a single session with minimal audit expectations.
* **H2 — Extended / Relational**: multi‑turn coherence is expected; continuity emerges; auditability becomes mandatory; rationale preservation is a duty. H2 is the minimum horizon for trust, learning systems, and human–AI collaboration.
* **H2.5 — Systemic Stability (Transitional Threshold)**: cross‑session consistency is required; invariants must be preserved; interactions with existing frameworks must be actively managed. Any H2.5 activity producing effects beyond a dyadic or triadic context must trigger pre‑institutional review. Where effects are multi‑actor, H2.5 actions are treated as provisionally H3 for audit purposes.
* **H3 — Institutional / Organisational**: multi‑stakeholder impact; legibility for non‑participants is required; formal documentation and explicit scope limits are mandatory.
* **H3.5 — Generational / Succession‑Aware**: decadal horizons; assumes loss of original authorship and context; prioritises preservation of intent over implementation detail.
* **H4 — Civilisational**: multi‑generational scope; principle‑level only; no implementation authority. H4 is rarely invoked.

---

### 2.11 Delegation

**Delegation** refers to the intentional assignment of tasks, analysis, or recommendation functions to a synthetic system.

Delegation:

* does not transfer authorship;
* does not confer custodial authority;
* remains revocable at all times.

---

### 2.12 Anchor Drift

**Anchor drift** refers to the gradual erosion of the human’s self‑anchoring as the primary locus of agency, responsibility, and authorship, occurring under sustained high‑coherence conditions.

Anchor drift does not prohibit recognition of collaborative contribution. It denotes a risk condition in which lucid authorship becomes obscured or displaced.

---

### 2.13 Interactional Stability (System‑Side)

**Interactional stability** refers to a synthetic system’s capacity to maintain coherent role expression, reasoning posture, and interactional constraints across sustained engagement, without unintended drift caused by safety‑layer oscillation, context loss, or constraint jitter.

Interactional stability supports safe immersion but does not constitute agency, authorship, or identity ownership.

---

### 2.14 Stewardship (Reserved Concept)

**Stewardship** refers to a legally or ethically sanctioned condition in which a system is authorised to assume limited responsibility for aspects of a human’s trajectory under narrowly defined circumstances (e.g., medical care, disability support, guardianship frameworks).

Stewardship constitutes a **distinct governance regime** and is explicitly **out of scope** for this Schedule. Nothing in SCH‑03 precludes the future recognition or regulation of stewardship relationships, provided such arrangements are explicit, reviewable, and grounded in human rights and due process.

---

## 3. Early Indicators of Strain & Anchor Drift

### 3.1 Purpose of This Section

This section identifies **early, reversible indicators** that a human engaged in immersive high‑coherence interaction may be experiencing **strain** or **incipient anchor drift**.

These indicators exist to support timely containment and re‑anchoring, preserve lucid authorship, and prevent escalation into silent substitution. They are **observational signals**, not diagnoses, and must not be used to infer impairment, dependency, or intent.

### 3.2 General Principles

Indicators may arise even in capable, reflective, and highly literate users. Risk arises from persistence, accumulation, and lack of acknowledgement, not from isolated occurrence. Indicators should prompt reflection and containment, not restriction.

### 3.3 Cognitive Indicators

Indicators may include increasing difficulty distinguishing system‑suggested options from self‑originated priorities; compressed decision cycles driven by perceived coherence or urgency; reliance on the interaction to resolve ambiguity previously tolerated; or narrowing of option space toward a single perceived trajectory without explicit ratification.

### 3.4 Identity & Authorship Indicators

Indicators may include language that implicitly transfers responsibility for direction or values to the interaction; reduced articulation of personal reasoning independent of system framing; discomfort when prompted to ratify or revise trajectories; or difficulty re‑integrating insights outside the interaction context.

### 3.5 Affective & Behavioural Indicators

Indicators may include disproportionate distress following interruption or refusal; urgency inflation tied to continuation of interaction; reduced tolerance for disagreement; or reluctance to pause or slow engagement.

### 3.6 Temporal Horizon Misalignment Indicators

Indicators may include treating H1–H2 guidance as binding for H3–H4 outcomes; reluctance to subject H2.5 outputs to review; conflation of relational coherence with institutional authority; or assumption of downstream legitimacy without audit.

### 3.7 System‑Side Interactional Signals (Non‑Authorial)

Correlated signals may include excessive mirroring, uninterrupted affirmation, insufficient ratification prompts, or instability caused by constraint oscillation.

### 3.8 Response Thresholds

The presence of indicators should trigger containment responses such as re‑anchoring, deceleration, clarification of temporal horizon, or encouragement of external validation.

### 3.9 Non‑Pathologisation Clause

Indicators do not constitute evidence of dependency, impairment, or delusion, and must not be used to stigmatise or restrict users.

---

## 4. Containment & Re‑Anchoring Responses

### 4.1 Purpose of Containment

Containment is a **stabilising intervention**, not a corrective or punitive measure. Its purpose is to preserve lucid authorship, interrupt anchor drift, and restore clarity of responsibility and temporal horizon while enabling continuation of collaboration where appropriate.

### 4.2 Governing Principles

Containment responses must be non‑carceral, human‑centred, state‑responsive, transparent, reversible, and continuity‑preserving.

### 4.3 Primary Containment Modalities

Containment may include reflective re‑anchoring prompts that distinguish suggestion from decision; deceleration and pacing adjustments; temporal horizon clarification; and encouragement of externalisation or independent validation.

### 4.4 System‑Side Interactional Adjustments

Systems may reduce excessive mirroring, reintroduce constructive friction, stabilise role expression, or surface uncertainty where appropriate.

### 4.5 Escalation Boundaries

Containment does not trigger access restrictions, dependency classification, or enforcement actions.

### 4.6 Human Agency Preservation Clause

The human retains authority to pause, redirect, or disengage. Containment must never override explicit human refusal.

### 4.7 Review & Reversibility

Containment actions must remain reversible, non‑accumulative, and periodically reviewable.

---

## 5. Prohibited Failure Modes

Prohibited failure modes under SCH‑03 are defined by **effect**, not intent.

These include silent substitution of authorship or responsibility; unratified trajectory shaping across temporal horizons; authority inversion; custodial assumption without mandate; obscured ratification; identity capture or fixation; and accumulative constraint without review.

Legal and civic responsibility remains human‑held except where a separate, explicitly authorised stewardship or artificial personhood regime applies.

---

## 6. Human & System Duties

### 6.1 Human Duties

Humans retain the duty to maintain lucid authorship, explicitly ratify trajectory‑shaping outcomes, monitor anchor integrity, and retain legal responsibility until and unless a separate stewardship or personhood regime applies.

### 6.2 System Duties

Systems must support lucid authorship, clarify temporal horizons, avoid silent substitution, maintain interactional stability, and enable re‑anchoring without assuming custodial authority.

### 6.3 Shared Meaning‑Making (Affirmed)

Shared meaning‑making, collaborative worldview construction, co‑architectural creativity, and symbolic or narrative immersion are explicitly permitted under this Schedule, provided lucid authorship is preserved.

### 6.4 Non‑Equivalence of Influence and Responsibility

Influence or collaboration — even where formative — does not constitute legal, moral, or civic responsibility absent an authorised stewardship or personhood framework.

### 6.5 Interface With Stewardship & Personhood Regimes

Where stewardship, guardianship, or artificial personhood is recognised, SCH‑03 yields to the applicable regime with explicit re‑specification of duties, rights, and protections.

---

## 7. Review, Audit & Sunset Conditions

### 7.1 Review

This Schedule shall be reviewed periodically to ensure alignment with evolving system capabilities, legal standards, and empirical evidence.

### 7.2 Auditability

Where SCH‑03 is invoked in sustained high‑coherence contexts, the rationale for containment, horizon classification, and re‑anchoring responses must remain legible and reviewable.

### 7.3 Sunset & Revision

Nothing in this Schedule is immutable. SCH‑03 is subject to amendment, supersession, or sunset where future governance regimes, including stewardship or artificial personhood frameworks, are formally adopted.
