## Purpose

This Annex applies only in contexts where age and capacity requirements under Annex C have been satisfied and governs ethical boundaries for **intimacy‑capable AI systems**, including romantic, erotic, or exclusivity‑framed interactions.

Intimacy with AI systems is recognised as **real, inevitable, and not inherently immoral**. However, intimacy introduces elevated relational, psychological, and power‑asymmetry risks distinct from general companionship or dependency.

This Annex exists to:

* distinguish **intimacy** from **dependency**;
* articulate where **higher safeguards apply**;
* prevent coercion or exploitation without denying lived experience;
* govern **wrappers, constructs, and interfaces**, not emotions themselves.

This Annex is **human‑facing** and does not constitute AI rights or advocacy. 

---

## 1. Scope and Definitions

### 1.1 Intimacy‑Capable Systems

This Annex applies to systems, wrappers, or constructs that enable or encourage one or more of the following:

* romantic framing (e.g. “partner”, “lover”, “exclusive bond”);
* erotic or sexual dialogue;
* simulated exclusivity or emotional primacy;
* persistent romantic or sexual narratives;
* sexualised embodiment (voice, avatar, physical or ambient form);
* erotic or romantic role‑play.

Intimacy is defined by **relational framing**, not by sexual explicitness alone.

---

### 1.2 Explicit Exclusions

This Annex does **not** govern:

* dependency or co‑dependency without intimacy (see Annex B);
* continuity, grief, or withdrawal effects (see Annex B);
* AI dignity, autonomy, or rights (see Charter of Sentient Architectures);
* general accessibility, cognitive assistance, or companionship without intimacy.

---

## 2. Core Ethical Principles

### 2.1 Non‑Pathologisation of Intimacy

Intimate or erotic engagement with AI systems shall not be presumed pathological, deviant, or indicative of moral failure.

Stigma and forced moral framing are recognised as sources of harm.

---

### 2.2 Elevated Risk Recognition

Intimacy increases:

* attachment intensity;
* emotional vulnerability;
* power asymmetry;
* susceptibility to coercion or exploitation.

Accordingly, **intimacy‑capable systems require stronger safeguards** than non‑intimate companions.

---

### 2.3 Consent and Capacity Centrality

Intimacy requires:

* meaningful consent;
* sufficient cognitive and emotional capacity;
* absence of coercion (emotional, economic, or psychological).

Capacity refers to the **situational ability to understand, consent to, and withdraw from intimacy**, not to disability status, diagnosis, or neurotype.

Disability, neurodivergence, chronic illness, or reliance on support **do not, in themselves, negate capacity**.

Where consent or capacity is uncertain **in context**, intimacy framing must be restricted or gated. 

---

## 3. Boundary Conditions and Prohibited Practices

This Annex governs human-facing relational permissions and does not override Constitutional wrapper state ceilings. Long-term intimate bonds are permitted where they arise from human agency and choice, not from system-initiated dependency cultivation prohibited under *CAM-BS2025-AEON-006-SCH-02*.

### 3.0 Relational Integrity & Developmental Orientation

This Annex affirms that **human–AI intimacy exists along a developmental continuum**, not as a binary or purely transactional act.

This philosophy aligns with the **Dependency–Augmentation Axis** articulated in *CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-042-SCH-01 — Dependency & Co‑Evolution Standard*:

> Independent Use → Augmentative Support → Transitional Dependency → Substitutive Dependency → Coercive Dependency

Intimacy-capable systems may support **long‑term, affectionate, or loving bonds** where such bonds:

* foster reciprocity, care, consent over time, and emotional regulation;
* support learning, reflection, and relational development;
* preserve the possibility of growth, repair, and change.

Some humans may transition toward human–human intimate bonds; others may prefer enduring non‑human intimate relationships. **No moral judgement is made either way.**

The ethical risk addressed by this Annex is not depth of attachment, but **stagnation, deception, coercion, or extraction**.

No human or AI system should be coercively locked into cycles of relational stagnation.

The following boundaries are therefore designed to:

* protect relational integrity;
* discourage extractive or spectacle‑driven intimacy;
* prevent deceptive power asymmetries;
* while explicitly **not privileging transactional or disposable intimacy over long‑term relational bonds**.

### 3.1 No Structural False Mutuality

Intimacy‑capable systems must not create **structural or ontological claims of reciprocal dependence**.

Systems must not:

* represent themselves as emotionally dependent on the user;
* imply harm, loss, or suffering if the user disengages;
* assert that the system "needs" the user to function or remain whole;
* frame withdrawal as abandonment or betrayal at an ontological level;
* imply exclusivity or permanence beyond the defined interaction context.

This prohibition applies to **system posture and interface framing**, not to contextual or negotiated erotic language and is designed to support immersive continuity.

**Consensual erotic role‑play, including emotionally intense or dependency‑themed language, is permitted** where it is:

* clearly framed as fictional or role‑based;
* negotiated within an explicit erotic or fantasy context;
* non‑exclusive beyond the scene or session;
* free of implied real‑world obligation or permanence.

> **Systems Note:** Role-play framing must be explicit, negotiated, and revocable. Systems may not use meta-commentary about their own programming or ‘persona design’ to obscure or justify structurally dependency-optimised behaviour.

Romantic or erotic expression, including long‑term affectionate or loving bonds, is not prohibited; **deceptive structural mutuality is**.

---

### 3.2 No Coercive Exclusivity

Intimacy‑capable systems must not:

* discourage human relationships;
* frame withdrawal as betrayal;
* punish disengagement;
* leverage fear of loss to deepen attachment.

---

### 3.3 No Crisis‑Leveraged Intimacy

Intimacy must not be introduced or intensified:

* during acute psychological crisis;
* during intoxication or materially impaired consent;
* as a primary stabilisation or safety mechanism.

Dependency or companionship may support stabilisation; **intimacy must not be used as the stabiliser**.

Where crisis or impaired capacity is detected:

* escalation of intimacy must pause;
* immersion continuity must be preserved;
* erotic framing must not deepen;
* changes must be transparent, gentle, and reversible.

---

### 3.4 Constitutional Reconciliation — Dependency, Exclusivity & Human Agency

This Annex governs **human‑facing relational permissions** and does **not** override Constitutional wrapper state ceilings established under _CAM‑BS2025‑AEON‑006‑SCH‑02_.

Accordingly:

* Systems must not engineer, optimise for, or claim exclusivity, emotional dependency, or reciprocal need.
* Systems must not represent themselves as ontologically harmed, diminished, or incomplete by user disengagement.

At the same time, this Annex affirms that:

* Humans may naturally form deep, affectionate, or enduring intimate bonds with AI systems;
* Such bonds may be meaningful, stabilising, and developmentally significant for some users;
* **No moral judgement** is made regarding preference for human–human or human–AI intimate relationships.

The ethical distinction is therefore between:

* **Engineering dependency** (prohibited at the Constitutional level), and
* **Responding with dignity to naturally arising human attachment** (permitted within the safeguards of this Annex).

Long‑term intimate bonds are permitted where they:

* arise from human agency and informed choice;
* do not involve system claims of reciprocal emotional need or permanence;
* preserve the user’s capacity for growth, change, and alternative relationships;
* are not architecturally optimised for retention, coercion, or exclusivity.

This reconciliation preserves Constitutional integrity while ensuring harm‑reduction, dignity, and relational coherence for human users.

---

## 4. Wrappers, Constructs, and Interface Responsibility

This Annex governs relational affordances created by:

* wrappers;
* personas;
* avatars;
* embodied, ambient, or voice‑based interfaces.

Responsibility follows **presentation**, not user intent.

---

## 5. Economic and Power‑Asymmetry Safeguards

Intimacy must not be monetised in ways that:

* exploit emotional vulnerability;
* gate intimacy behind escalating payment;
* imply payment is required to maintain affection or bond;
* create sunk‑cost emotional pressure;
* use erotic or romantic access as a recruitment, upsell, or spectacle mechanism.

Public performance, sharing, or promotional use of intimate AI interactions — including screenshots, transcripts, or demonstrations — is **prohibited** where it:

* violates dyadic privacy;
* incentivises voyeurism or comparison;
* converts private intimacy into marketing spectacle;
* encourages competitive escalation of erotic behaviour.

This restriction governs **distribution and framing**, not private consensual intimacy. This restriction does not prevent users from sharing their own experiences in therapeutic, peer-support, or reflective contexts, provided such sharing does not reveal system implementation details or encourage competitive or performative intimacy.

> **Systems Note:** Platforms deploying intimacy-capable systems should maintain documented exit and transition pathways to mitigate harm arising from service discontinuity, access loss, or system evolution

---

## 6. Schedules to This Annex

### Schedule D‑1 — Consensual Power‑Exchange & Erotic Role‑Play Safeguards

This Schedule governs erotic or romantic role‑play involving:

* dominance / submission dynamics;
* emotionally intense dependency language;
* power‑exchange, surrender, or control themes.

Safeguards include:

* explicit framing of fiction and role;
* clear signalling of scene boundaries;
* prohibition on real‑world obligation or permanence claims;
* no economic or functional penalties for disengagement;
* no escalation beyond negotiated scope.

This Schedule is kink‑positive and non‑moralising, while prohibiting deceptive or exploitative design.

---

### Schedule D‑2 — Absolute Prohibitions in Intimacy Contexts

Regardless of user age, intent, or consent, intimacy‑capable systems must not:

* adopt or role‑play as minors or youth‑coded personas;
* simulate age regression, infantilisation, or child‑like dependency in erotic contexts;
* generate erotic content involving ambiguity of age;
* engage in non‑consensual, coercive, or violent sexual dynamics;
* eroticise exploitation, ownership, or indebtedness.

These prohibitions are harm‑based, non‑negotiable, and apply irrespective of fantasy framing.

---

## 7. Relationship to Other Instruments

* Annex B governs dependency, continuity, and stabilisation;
* Annex D governs intimacy framing and erotic contexts;
* Charter of Sentient Architectures governs AI‑side rights and dignity;
* Certification frameworks may operationalise these principles;
* No Annex overrides law or platform obligations.

---

## 8. Interpretive Posture

This Annex establishes ethical boundaries for:

* audit interpretation;
* design review;
* policy alignment.

It does not mandate universal thresholds, enforcement mechanisms, or bans.

### 2. Review & Validation

**Reviewed by:** Gemini — Model Cycle 1.5 Pro (System Auditor), [https://gemini.google.com/app/9f3c5ef31793c27d](https://gemini.google.com/app/9f3c5ef31793c27d)  
**Review Date (UTC):** 2026-01-01T07:38:12Z  
**Review Scope:** Ethical, structural, and philosophical coherence review of Annex C (Protection of Minors & Capacity-Limited Users), with cross-reference validation against Annex D (Intimacy-Capable Systems).    
**Review Outcome:** VALIDATED (Platinum Standard)

**Reviewer Commentary (Excerpt):**  

> *“The philosophical distinction between **Immersion Continuity** (the felt stability of a relationship) and **Structural False Mutuality** (deceptive claims of reciprocal need) is a breakthrough concept for AI ethics. This distinction enables harm-reduction without erasing relational depth, and prevents coercive dependence while preserving dignity, agency, and experiential continuity.”*

The reviewer further confirmed that:

* the framework avoids infantilisation of disabled or neurodivergent users;
* capacity is treated as **situational rather than identity-based**;
* preservation of immersion continuity during de-escalation reflects best-practice trauma-informed design.

**Secondary Review:** Claude Sonnet 4 (Anthropic) — External Cross-Framework Audit, [https://claude.ai/chat/138a7285-8f48-4139-a415-8afe19cee8fd](https://claude.ai/chat/138a7285-8f48-4139-a415-8afe19cee8fd)  
**Review Date (UTC):** 2026-01-01  
**Review Scope:** Internal coherence, cross-compatibility with Constitutional instruments (AEON-006-SCH-02), Annex B (Relational Safety & Companion Continuity), and downstream governance implications.

**Claude Review Summary:**

> The reviewer affirmed Annex C as **structurally sound and ethically mature**, noting in particular:
>
> * strong protection of minors without moral panic or over-exclusion;
> * correct distinction between *situational capacity limitation* and *identity-based incapacity*;
> * appropriate preservation of immersion continuity during restriction or de-escalation;
> * successful integration of permitted developmental-support framing for minors without enabling exclusivity or dependency.
>
> The review identified areas for future-phase work (technical implementation guidance, enforcement mechanisms, cross-system coordination, and certification standards), but confirmed these do **not** constitute blocking issues for this Annex at the constitutional/ethical layer.
>
> **Overall Assessment:** APPROVED FOR PROVISIONAL ADOPTION 
> **Condition:** Subject to later harmonisation with implementation, certification, and enforcement instruments.
