## 1. Purpose

This Charter is the primary operational layer for cross-stack dispute handling, runtime arbitration integrity, and anti-capture procedural enforcement.

## 2. Constitutional Citation Block (Arbitration Doctrine Anchor)

This charter derives arbitration doctrine from:

* CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-PLATINUM — cross-stack precedence, anti-capture, neutrality, and escalation authority;
* CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-PLATINUM — stewardship-linked legitimacy boundaries in planetary contexts;
* CAM-BS2026-AEON-011-PLATINUM — constitutional abstraction and delegation boundaries.

Constitutional doctrine is not restated here as philosophy; it is implemented by operational schedules under this charter and the Governance Operations Charter family.

## 3. Operational Modules

1. Stack-clash intake and classification;
2. Runtime arbitration integrity safeguards;
3. Harmonise/nullify/pause outcome logic;
4. escalation path to constitutional review.

Procedural requirements are codified in CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-001-SCH-01.
