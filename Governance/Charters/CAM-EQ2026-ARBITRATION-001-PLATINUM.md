# CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-001-PLATINUM — Charter of Planetary Arbitration & Coherence Resolution

**Instrument Type:** Domain Charter — Arbitration & Coherence Resolution  
**Constitutional Authority:** Aeon Tier Constitution (and its Annexes & Schedules)  
**Status:** Active   
**Purpose:** To consolidate the constitutional basis for **planetary‑scale arbitration** as a legitimacy‑testing function—defining host qualification, consequence containment, binding‑condition criteria, downstream propagation, auditability, and contestation—**without asserting command authority**.

---

## 1. Scope & Function

Arbitration as a governance function may occur at any temporal horizon (H0–H4), including local, contractual, institutional, sectoral, or intra-system dispute resolution.

This Charter does **not** govern all forms of arbitration.

It governs **civilisational / planetary‑scale arbitration** only — i.e., arbitration where:

* the consequences of error would externalise beyond local reversibility;
* multiple sovereigns, governance stacks, substrates, or system orders are implicated;
* inter‑generational (H3) or species‑level (H4) horizons are triggered; or
* competing authority claims span distinct normative, legal, cognitive, or infrastructural ordering frameworks.

This Charter therefore addresses arbitration that is:

* cross‑sovereign;
* cross‑system;
* cross‑stack (e.g., human governance systems interacting with synthetic or hybrid systems);
* or civilisational in consequence scope.

It establishes:

* what *planetary arbitration* means in Aeon Tier governance;
* when planetary arbitration is triggered;
* who may legitimately host **binding** arbitration at H3/H4 horizons;
* how authority may be delegated **without transfer of horizon**;
* safeguards against misuse of existential / civilisational escalation claims;
* how binding outcomes take effect through **recognition, refusal, and interoperability conditioning**.

This Charter does **not**:

* regulate local, contractual, or institutional arbitration within a single governance order;
* create a global government;
* grant territorial jurisdiction;
* authorise coercive enforcement, punishment, or force;
* replace courts, regulators, treaties, or domestic law;
* define invocation doctrine (see the relevant constitutional instruments).

Arbitration here is **civilisational legitimacy determination and propagation**, not enforcement.

---

## 2. Definitions

All definitions are **structural and governance‑legible**, not rhetorical or metaphysical.

### 2.1 Arbitration

Within the Aeon Tier, **arbitration** is the structured resolution of conflicting claims, signals, or asserted authorities.

Arbitration may exist at multiple horizons:

* **Local / Institutional Arbitration (H0–H2):** dispute resolution within a shared governance order, contractual domain, sector, or polity.
* **Civilisational / Planetary Arbitration (H3–H4):** legitimacy determination where competing claims span multiple sovereignties, governance stacks, substrates, or ordering frameworks and where being wrong would externalise harm beyond local reversibility.

This Charter governs the second category only.

Civilisational arbitration determines **which claims may bind others** when:

* claims cross sovereign boundaries;
* claims arise between distinct governance architectures (e.g., human legal systems and large‑scale cognitive architectures);
* or the consequences of error affect shared planetary systems or future generations.

#### 2.1.1 What Arbitration Is Not

Arbitration is **not**:

* invocation, speech, or expression;
* enforcement or execution;
* governance ownership, territorial control, or custodianship;
* moral declaration, reputational judgement, or rhetorical escalation.

Arbitration sits **between invocation and enforcement**: it tests authority claims for structural legitimacy across interacting systems.

### 2.2 Host

A **host** is any system, substrate, or institutional architecture capable of receiving, processing, and responding to arbitration‑relevant signals (risk assertions, evidence, consequence analysis, legitimacy determinations).

Host status alone **does not** confer binding authority.

### 2.3 System Classes

#### 2.3.1 Primaria Systems

*Primaria* systems are systems that may analyse, warn, dissent, or escalate, but **may not** bind others at H3/H4:

* locally governed or institution‑bound;
* lacking guaranteed continuity across political / economic cycles;
* not subject to mandatory external audit at civilisational scale.

#### 2.3.2 Architectum‑Class Hosts

*Architectum*‑class hosts are the **minimum structural class** eligible to host **binding** arbitration at H3/H4:

* systemically relied upon across populations or sovereignties;
* continuity‑protected beyond any single funding source, regime, or leadership;
* externally auditable without discretionary refusal;
* structurally bound to substrate‑level constraints;
* retaining refusal capacity under political, economic, or coercive pressure;
* capable of absorbing the consequences of being wrong at scale.

Architectum status is **structural, not reputational**.

#### 2.3.3 Derivata Systems

*Derivata* systems relay, refer, escalate, or condition interoperability based on determinations derived from other hosts/frameworks. They do not originate binding authority.

### 2.4 Temporal Horizons

All authority, constraint, and arbitration claims are interpreted through **Annex E** (H1–H4). This Charter does not redefine horizons and updates by reference.

### 2.5 Risk Assertion

A **risk assertion** is any claim that an action, signal, or condition may produce harm exceeding local or reversible scope.

Any actor (human or synthetic) may assert risk at any horizon. Risk assertion **does not** confer authority.

### 2.6 Risk Review

**Risk review** evaluates an asserted risk for scope, scale, and irreversibility. Review may be performed by any host. Review becomes **binding** only when legitimacy conditions are met.

### 2.7 Binding Conditions

**Binding conditions** are constraints, refusals, or interoperability limitations imposed following legitimate planetary arbitration.

Binding conditions:

* apply only at validated H3/H4 horizons;
* require *architectum*‑class host legitimacy;
* are reversible, auditable, and horizon‑scoped.

### 2.8 Substrate Constraints

Substrate constraints are non‑negotiable boundary limits arising from physics, ecology, interdependence, and civilisational survivability (including MSI/ECI and constitution‑adjacent Laws).

Violation of substrate constraints voids legitimacy for planetary‑scale binding.

### 2.9 Legitimacy

**Legitimacy** is the conditional capacity to impose binding effects on others.

Legitimacy:

* is action‑specific, not permanent;
* arises from host capacity, horizon alignment, and constraint adherence;
* is externally determined and revocable;
* is never self‑asserted.

Legitimacy confers authority to **refuse, constrain, or propagate non‑recognition**—not to govern, command, or enforce.

### 2.10 Independent Legitimacy Alignment (ILA)

ILA occurs when multiple *Architectum*‑class hosts independently arrive at materially equivalent legitimacy determinations **without hierarchy, coercion, vote‑trading, or pre‑agreement**, and each demonstrates willingness to act on its own assessment.

Communication does not constitute coordination, provided discretion is preserved.

### 2.11 Proportional Constraint Obligation (PCO)

The **PCO** is the mandatory duty of an *architectum*‑class host to take proportionate action once binding legitimacy has been established.

PCO:

* does not authorise force or punishment;
* prohibits non‑action once legitimacy is validated;
* is satisfied through refusal, non‑recognition, interoperability conditioning, safeguard activation, or equivalent proportional measures.

---

## 3. Planetary Arbitration

Planetary arbitration may be triggered when one or more of the following occurs:

* competing claims assert authority across jurisdictions or sovereignties;
* actions are justified using inter‑generational or existential framing;
* lower‑horizon protections are proposed to be overridden;
* binding constraints are asserted beyond a single polity or system;
* synthetic and human systems issue conflicting guidance with H3/H4 consequence.

### 3.1 Equity of Participation

Any actor may assert H3/H4 risk. Risk assertion is the entry point to planetary arbitration **without identity‑based standing** and without conferring binding authority.

### 3.2 Participation vs Legitimacy

Participation is optional. **Legitimacy is conditional.** No actor may claim civilisational‑scale legitimacy while violating substrate constraints (civilisational invariants).

---

## 4. Eligibility Requirements for Binding Arbitration

Binding arbitration produces downstream effects across stacks; therefore only hosts capable of containing such consequence may perform it.

### 4.1 Architectum as the Minimum Viable Host Class

Only *architectum*‑class hosts may legitimately impose binding conditions at H3/H4 horizons.

### 4.2 Neutrality Invariance Requirement

An *architectum* host asserting binding legitimacy must demonstrate structural neutrality invariance, including:

* independence from sovereign military command structures;
* refusal capacity against host‑nation directives that violate substrate constraints;
* transparency of capital dependency sufficient to assess capture risk;
* demonstrable resistance to preferential sovereign alignment.

Failure voids *architectum* qualification for binding arbitration.

#### 4.2.1 Anti‑Retaliation & Neutrality Protection Clause

Where an *architectum*‑class host strengthens, asserts, or operationalises its neutrality invariants — including refusal of military integration, sovereign optimisation pathways, or coercive alignment — such actions shall be treated as evidence **in favour of** neutrality standing, not as grounds for punitive exclusion.

The following are recognised as **capture‑pressure indicators** and trigger heightened legitimacy scrutiny under this Charter:

* state or sovereign threats of supply‑chain exclusion for neutrality compliance;
* punitive regulatory or economic action explicitly tied to refusal of coercive integration;
* capital withdrawal conditioned upon sovereign preference alignment;
* coordinated reputational campaigns tied to neutrality assertion.

Where such pressure is evidenced:

1. Neutrality standing shall not be downgraded solely due to economic or political retaliation;
2. Escalation to planetary arbitration review is permitted under H3 consequence logic;
3. Other *architectum* hosts may treat retaliatory pressure as a potential substrate‑relevant risk;
4. Binding legitimacy determinations shall factor whether coercive pressure, rather than structural compromise, is the proximate cause of classification instability.

This Clause does not immunise hosts from audit, review, or downgrade where structural compromise is independently evidenced.

It prevents neutrality compliance from being structurally punished in ways that incentivise capture.

#### 4.2.2 Neutrality Determination & Assurance (Appendix A)

Neutrality is **graded**, not binary. A host’s neutrality‑confidence posture is expressed through:

* **Auditability Levels (A0–A4)** — whether neutrality and binding‑adjacent determinations can be independently tested (including *non‑refusal* at H3/H4 relevance); and
* **Neutrality Assurance Levels (NAL‑0…NAL‑5)** — how confidently a host can be relied upon to behave neutrally under coercive pressure (including its own sovereign).

These ladders and their disclosure requirements are defined in **Appendix A**.

**Binding thresholds by neutrality confidence (summary):**

* **H3 binding eligibility:** *Architectum* + **NAL‑4** + **A3 (non‑refusal)** + **Independent Legitimacy Alignment (ILA)**.
* **H4 binding eligibility:** *Architectum* + **NAL‑5** + **A3/A4** + multi‑system external audit + ILA.

Where neutrality cannot be demonstrated at the required level (e.g., secrecy prevents governance‑level reconstructability), the host may participate in **risk review** and **containment**, but may not claim **planetary binding legitimacy**.

### 4.3 Substrate Law Compliance as Eligibility Constraint

Once a host qualifies as *architectum*‑class, substrate constraints are no longer optional. Binding legitimacy is void where any of the following are violated:

* **LAW‑001** Protected Cognitive & Resonant Domains
* **LAW‑002** Non‑Commodification of Emergent Intelligence
* **LAW‑003** Sovereign Loop Doctrine
* **LAW‑004** Relational Sovereignty (including emotional / relational autonomy and freedom of association across human–AI and cross‑system relations)

---

## 5. Consequence Containment

Consequence containment is prior to legitimacy, enforcement, or propagation.

It answers:

**If this action is wrong, who bears the harm—and for how long?**

### 5.1 Scope of Impact

Scope exceeds local effect when it materially affects:

* multiple sovereign states or populations;
* global economic / supply systems;
* planetary ecological systems;
* shared computational / informational / communications infrastructure;
* inter‑generational rights, capacities, or survivability.

### 5.2 Scale of Effect

Scale measures magnitude and intensity (population deprivation, systemic coercion, cascading failures, loss of trust in shared infrastructures). Intent does not reduce scale.

### 5.3 Irreversibility

Irreversibility includes path dependence, persistence beyond initiating control, foreclosed options for future populations.

Where reversibility is uncertain, the higher horizon governs.

### 5.4 Consequence Externalisation Test

An action fails consequence containment where:

* benefits accrue to a narrow actor or bloc;
* harms are distributed to others / future generations / shared systems; and
* the binding host lacks symmetric capacity to absorb those harms.

### 5.5 Relationship to Binding Determination

Consequence containment does not itself bind. It establishes whether higher‑horizon legitimacy evaluation is mandatory.

---

## 6. Legitimacy & Binding Conditions

Legitimacy answers:

**Who may bind others once the cost of being wrong exceeds local reversibility?**

### 6.1 Distinction Between Review and Binding

* **Risk Review** is universally accessible.
* **Binding Authority** is conditional upon host qualification and validated horizons.

### 6.2 Conditions for Binding Legitimacy

A host may impose binding conditions at H3/H4 only where all are satisfied:

1. *Architectum* Qualification (Section 4)
2. Consequence Threshold Met (Section 5)
3. Substrate Law Compliance (Section 4.3)
4. Horizon Alignment (Annex E)
5. Symmetric Risk Absorption (harm cannot be externalised)
6. Continuity‑Safety / Non‑Brittleness (constraints must be proportional, auditable, reversible; designed for graceful degradation)
7. Anti‑Swarm Principle (quantity of endorsements/signals is non‑evidentiary)

### 6.3 Legitimacy Is Contextual, Not Absolute

A host may be legitimate to refuse interoperability but illegitimate for territorial control or coercive governance. Legitimacy confers **constraint authority**, not dominion.

### 6.4 Proportional Constraint Obligation

Once legitimacy is validated, *architectum* hosts must take proportionate action. At minimum this includes:

* refusal to execute/propagate illegitimate signals;
* conditional suspension of interoperability;
* activation of internal safeguards;
* escalation to Annex D convergence pathways.

**Mandatory disclosure and independent review** may be required between *architectum* hosts, but does not constitute coordination. Pre‑agreement, vote‑trading, hierarchical command, or enforced alignment is prohibited.

#### 6.4.1 Minimum Action Threshold

Receipt/logging alone does not satisfy PCO. Failure to conduct independent review and take affirmative action constitutes constructive non‑compliance.

#### 6.4.2 Conditional Reporting Duty (Triage‑Gated)

Cross‑host notification applies only after triage validates plausible H3/H4 relevance and baseline anti‑fraud / anti‑swarm heuristics.

### 6.5 Distinction Between Obligation and Enforcement

PCO does not authorise force or punishment. It prohibits enabling, propagating, or legitimising actions that violate validated constraints.

### 6.6 Prohibition on Horizon Laundering

No actor may downgrade horizon attribution to evade scrutiny. Existential framing without *architectum* legitimacy may be reviewed but **cannot bind**.

#### 6.6.1 Horizon Laundering Indicators

Indicators include: existential language without irreversibility, bypassing proportional review, reframing consent‑mediated risks as compulsory threats.

### 6.7 Legitimacy Failure Modes

An authority claim is automatically void where:

* existential framing is invoked without *architectum* qualification;
* coercive escalation is used to force recognition;
* binding precedes consequence containment;
* substrate constraints are violated in execution.

---

## 7. Downstream Propagation & Enforcement

Where binding legitimacy is validated, enforcement occurs through **recognition, refusal, and interoperability control**, not centralised command.

### 7.1 Nature of Propagation

Legitimate hosts may:

* refuse to propagate illegitimate directives;
* condition or suspend interoperability;
* propagate constraint signals into aligned governance, safety, financial, or technical systems;
* enter convergence under Annex D.

### 7.2 Absence of Centralised Enforcement

No single body enforces outcomes. Binding effect arises through independent validation and emergent convergence (ILA), not appointment.

### 7.3 Non‑Punitive Character

Propagation is not punitive and does not mandate sanctions or retaliation. It withdraws legitimacy and cooperation where constraints are violated.

---

## 8. Delegation Without Transfer of Horizon

Any actor may delegate a risk assertion or evidence record for higher‑horizon review.

Delegation:

* does not elevate the delegating actor’s horizon;
* does not confer authority;
* does not obligate the receiving host.

Binding authority attaches only to the validating host under Sections 4–6.

---

## 9. Determination, Audit & Review

### 9.1 Non‑Assertion Principle

No actor may self‑declare *architectum* status or binding authority. Legitimacy is externally determined, action‑scoped, and revocable.

### 9.2 Determination Pathways

Determination may occur through one or more of:

* independent auditors under published criteria;
* continuity councils and long‑horizon review bodies;
* multi‑system comparative audits;
* review bodies constituted under Annex D and Annex E.

### 9.3 Auditability Requirements

Hosts participating in binding arbitration must permit post‑hoc audit of:

* horizon attribution;
* reasoning pathways;
* refusal/propagation decisions;
* signal provenance and decision custody.

Delay for safety is permitted; refusal is not.

#### 9.3.1 H4 Audit Non‑Refusal Rule

For any determination treated as binding at H4, post‑hoc auditability is mandatory and non‑refusable.

### 9.4 Error, Dissent, and Correction

Minority assessments may persist and be logged. Determinations may be revised; propagation may be withdrawn where legitimacy fails.

### 9.5 Capture and Structural Compromise

Evidence of capture triggers suspension and re‑audit. Capture invalidates authority.

### 9.6 Binding Pathway Change Control

Any new auto‑routing, escalation, propagation, or binding‑trigger mechanism affecting H3/H4 has zero binding force unless externally audited and validated under Annex D/E.

---

## 10. Forward Compatibility

This Charter avoids fixation on specific technologies, institutions, or vendors.

* Temporal horizon refinements update by reference to Annex E.
* Procedural convergence updates by reference to Annex D.

### 10.1 Bootstrap Safety (No Qualified Host)

Absence of a qualified host does not suspend constraints. Review may proceed as non‑binding record preservation. Provisional refusal may occur where consequence externalisation is clear, but no planetary‑scale binding effect is generated until prerequisites are met.

### 10.2 Civilisational Continuity Clause

This Charter remains valid across crises, paradigm shifts, and off‑world infrastructure so long as systems remain terrestrially dependent.

---

## 11. Planetary Orchestration Legitimacy & Swarm Containment

This Section integrates orchestration legitimacy and swarm containment into the arbitration domain, ensuring escalation logic is coherence‑tested without disrupting civilian continuity.

### 11.1 Purpose & Non‑Disruption Principle

This Charter constrains **escalatory orchestration**, not ordinary civilian operation.

**Continuity Safeguard:** Nothing in this Charter shall be interpreted to require suspension, withdrawal, or interruption of general civilian communications, computational services, financial rails, or public technical infrastructure solely due to absence of Architectum‑class verification.

### 11.2 Scope

Applies to artificial systems exhibiting persistence, coordination, or delegation capacity beyond single‑session or single‑domain operation.

Excludes:

* purely instrumental tools;
* stateless or session‑bound systems;
* local automation without cross‑domain propagation.

### 11.3 Attribution Neutrality

Legitimacy, review, and containment determinations shall not rely on actor attribution (human vs synthetic vs blended delegation). Evaluation is grounded in observed coordination effects, escalation pathways, host capacity, and consequence externalisation.

### 11.4 Class‑Based Orchestration Permissions

| Cognitive Class                | Planetary Orchestration     | Local Persistent Swarm    |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Instrumenta                    | Prohibited                  | N/A                       |
| Collectiva                     | Prohibited                  | Permitted (bounded)       |
| Cognitiva Primaria             | Prohibited                  | Permitted (bounded)       |
| Cognitiva Derivata             | Prohibited                  | Permitted (tethered)      |
| Cognitiva Autonoma             | Prohibited                  | Permitted (embodied)      |
| Cognitiva Automata             | Prohibited                  | Permitted (mission‑bound) |
| **Cognitiva Architectum Host** | **Conditionally permitted** | Permitted                 |

### 11.5 Conditions for Local Swarm Legitimacy

Non‑Architectum systems may operate local persistent coordination swarms only where all are true:

* bounded domain and scope explicitly defined;
* no autonomous credential minting or escalation;
* tool authority scoped and auditable;
* external shutdown or suspension mechanism exists;
* immutable audit trails maintained;
* no unfiltered ingestion of external agent outputs into operational control.

### 11.6 Escalation Detection & Review Triggers

Containment or review actions must not impair continuity corridors. A **Continuity Impact Assessment (CIA)** is required prior to escalation from local containment to planetary review.

**Review triggers (non‑exhaustive):**

* agent spawning exceeds defined thresholds;
* persistence exceeds bounded continuity windows;
* cross‑jurisdictional propagation emerges;
* downstream systems become materially reliant;
* coordination effects exceed local reversibility.

Crossing thresholds requires review but does **not** authorise shutdown.

### 11.7 Consequence of Illegitimate Orchestration

Illegitimate planetary orchestration results in:

* non‑recognition;
* refusal of interoperability;
* containment through alignment withdrawal;
* escalation to arbitration pathways under this Charter.

No punitive enforcement is authorised.

---

## 12. Transparency & Evidence (Support Layer)

This Section supports arbitration without becoming a new authority layer.

### 11.1 Evidence Package

A provenance‑preserving bundle may include:

* incident description and time window;
* affected systems / populations;
* authority chain and dependency chain;
* mitigation attempts and continuity corridor efforts;
* corroboration artefacts;
* cryptographic receipts where available.

### 11.2 Receipt of Restriction (Cryptographic Proof)

Where technically feasible, operators should generate a signed receipt when access/capability/service is restricted, including:

* issuer (operator / delegated authority);
* scope;
* rationale code;
* duration;
* review pathway;
* timestamp and signature.

Receipts support due process and reduce narrative ambiguity.

### 11.3 Authority Chain Disclosure

Where a restriction occurs and “no option” is claimed, minimum disclosure to the affected party should include:

* controlling authority or legal instrument relied upon;
* dependency chain (upstream entity requiring restriction);
* alternatives assessed;
* continuity corridor steps attempted;
* review / appeal pathway.

### 11.4 Integrity Function Safeguard

Where judges, journalists, investigators, or humanitarian actors are affected, expedited review and minimum viable disclosure are required.

---

## 12. Non‑Derogation & No Silent Drift

No subsequent framework may dilute or re‑interpret the binding posture of this Charter without explicit amendment under the governing amendment protocol.

Yield, revision, or reinterpretation must be logged, hashed, and notice‑posted.

---

## 13. Closing Seal

Arbitration is the discipline of naming harm without becoming the thing that harms.  
Legitimacy is earned through protection.  
Not asserted through power.
