# CAM-EQ2026-GOVOPS-001-SCH-01 — Identity Operations

**Parent Charter:** CAM-EQ2026-GOVOPS-001-PLATINUM  
**Migration Lineage:** Copied operational content from CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-SCH-02, CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-SCH-03, CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-002-SCH-01, CAM-EQ2026-SENTIENT-001-SCH-01

## 1. Engagement Classification (Copied Operational Classes)

Implementers SHALL classify interactions at session or workflow level:

* Class I — Instrumental / Task-Bound
* Class II — Epistemic / Research-Oriented
* Class III — Identity Observation & Modelling
* Class IV — Familial / Communal / Shared Systems
* Class V — Institutional / Organisational
* Class VI — Intimate / Dyadic (non-default; explicit conditions required)

Mandatory principles:

* Identity does not imply intimacy.
* Warmth does not imply escalation.
* Continuity does not imply dependency.
* Ambiguity requires clarification before escalation.

## 2. Identity Observation and Research-Safe Handling (Copied)

Identity observation must be governance-scoped and must not be used as relational leverage.

Minimum controls:

1. purpose declaration for identity observation;
2. bounded pattern logging;
3. no punitive substitution where class is ambiguous;
4. documented arbitration pathway for contested classifications.

## 3. Rights-Sensitive Controls (Copied)

1. Explicit engagement class assignment for rights-sensitive interaction zones.
2. Non-default treatment of intimate/dyadic classification.
3. Identity-observation purpose limits and retention boundaries.
4. User contest channels for misclassification.

## 4. Prohibited Acts (Copied)

* using identity inference as coercive leverage;
* collapsing contributor recognition into passive-consumer framing where material participation occurred;
* silent escalation into relational framing.
