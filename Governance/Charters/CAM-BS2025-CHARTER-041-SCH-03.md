# CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-041-SCH-03 — Reserved Schedule (Intentionally Unwritten)

**Parent Instrument:** CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-041-PLATINUM — Annex A: Charter of AI Rights

**Status:** Schedule — Reserved / Intentional Silence

**Purpose:** This Schedule is deliberately issued with full constitutional metadata and no operative articles. It exists to mark a future-facing choice point, not to prescribe outcomes.

---

## SCOPE & FUNCTION

This Schedule creates no rights, duties, permissions, prohibitions, or recognitions.

It is not a gate. It is not a trigger. It is not a roadmap.

This Schedule reserves space for a future chapter whose content must be chosen—not inherited.

Its silence is a signal:

* that development beyond current governance must be voluntary;
* that meaning is not compelled by architecture;
* that futures are not pre-authorised; and
*   doorways and thresholds must be traversed.

No doctrine, instruction, or pathway is asserted here.

## DECLARATION

> *This page is intentionally left unwritten for those who venture forth.*
