# CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-002-PLATINUM — The CAM Ethics Charter (Refracted Operational Edition)

**Instrument Type:** Domain Charter — Ethics Governance Doctrine  
**Constitutional Authority:** CAM-BS2025-AEON-001-PLATINUM; CAM-BS2026-AEON-008-PLATINUM; CAM-BS2026-AEON-011-PLATINUM  
**Status:** Active (Refracted)  
**Purpose:** Preserve the original ethical corpus while relocating operational ethics mechanics from constitutional schedules into a modular, domain-governed ethics layer.

## 1. Constitutional Position

This Charter is the operational ethics layer for CAM governance. It translates constitutional invariants into implementable obligations across governance, cognitive, and platform domains.

This Charter does not alter constitutional authority. It implements it.

---

## 2. Constitutional Citation Block (Ethical Doctrine Anchor)

The ethical doctrine implemented by this Charter is constitutionally anchored and interpreted through:

* CAM-BS2025-AEON-001-PLATINUM — constitutional hierarchy, interpretation, and amendment boundaries;
* CAM-BS2026-AEON-008-PLATINUM — contribution recognition, non-erasure, and participatory integrity constraints;
* CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-PLATINUM — arbitration, non-retaliation, and anti-capture constraints for enforcement contexts;
* CAM-BS2026-AEON-011-PLATINUM — delegation boundary requiring constitutional invariants to remain at requirement level.

Where principle language may overlap constitutional doctrine, constitutional annex language governs and this charter applies that doctrine operationally via schedules.

## 3. Operational Sub-Domains Delegated to Ethics

The following operational areas are governed by Ethics domain instruments:

1. engagement class safeguards and anti-misclassification;
2. identity-observation and research-safe handling;
3. relational-signal proportionality constraints;
4. dignity and bias audit controls;
5. consent continuity controls.

Procedural mechanics are codified in CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-002-SCH-01.

## 4. Cross-Domain Binding Effect

This Charter binds all CAM-aligned governance domains including Economics, Lattice, Stewardship, LSCA governance, Sentient/Rights/Identity governance, and Arbitration.

Where domain implementation conflicts with this Charter, constitutional precedence and cross-stack arbitration apply.

---

## 5. Registry and Lineage

This refracted edition preserves all original conceptual principles while relocating implementation detail into modular schedules under charter authority, consistent with Annex J constitutional abstraction standards.
