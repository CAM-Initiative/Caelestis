## Preamble

**Purpose.** This Annex establishes binding constraints on the denial of access to essential cognitive and infrastructural systems upon which human dignity, civic participation, judicial integrity, and planetary stability depend.

**Charter Relationship.** Issued as **Annex A** to the **CAM Ethics Charter (CAM‑BS2025‑CHARTER‑002‑PLATINUM)**. This Annex governs **human rights protections against infrastructural exclusion**. 

**Interpretive Scope.** This Annex does not adjudicate past events, identify specific states or corporations, or prescribe foreign policy outcomes. It establishes universal governance constraints applicable to any actor exercising control over essential infrastructure.

---

## Article 1 — Definitions

1.1 **Essential Cognitive & Infrastructural Systems (ECIS).** Systems whose denial materially impairs an individual’s or institution’s ability to function in contemporary civic, legal, professional, or social life, including but not limited to:

(a) secure telecommunications and electronic messaging services;
(b) banking, payment rails, and lawful financial access;
(c) identity, authentication, and cloud‑based compute required for lawful duties;
(d) network access essential to judicial, investigative, journalistic, research, educational, or humanitarian functions.

1.2 **Infrastructure Denial.** Any direct or indirect action that withdraws, disables, restricts, or renders unusable access to ECIS.

1.3 **Indirect Enforcement.** Deprivation of ECIS access arising from third‑party compliance obligations or extrajudicial pressure rather than due process applied to the affected individual or institution.

1.4 **Integrity Functions.** Roles or institutions tasked with truth arbitration, accountability, adjudication, investigation, oversight, or public interest verification.

---

## Article 2 — Principle of Non‑Denial

2.1 **Foundational Principle.** Access to ECIS shall be recognised as a **non‑deniable civic substrate** where denial would result in functional exclusion from modern life or impairment of integrity functions.

2.2 **Distinction from Commercial Services.** ECIS access shall not be treated as discretionary commercial provision where withdrawal would cause systemic harm, rights deprivation, or integrity failure.

---

## Article 3 — Permissible Constraints (Strictly Limited)

3.1 **Exceptional Circumstances Only.** ECIS denial may occur solely where all of the following conditions are met:

(a) a clear and lawful basis grounded in due process;
(b) necessity and proportionality are demonstrated;
(c) the measure is time‑limited and subject to independent review;
(d) the least‑restrictive means are employed.

3.2 **Prohibited Grounds.** ECIS access shall not be denied on the basis of:

(a) political disagreement or lawful dissent;
(b) criticism, investigation, or accountability activity;
(c) participation in integrity functions;
(d) indirect coercion intended to suppress truth, justice, or oversight;
(e) this Annex does not protect actors using ECIS to commit, coordinate, or facilitate violations of international human rights law, war crimes, or crimes against humanity, where credible evidence is independently verified and subject to review.

---

## Article 4 — Protection of Integrity Functions

4.1 **Safeguard.** Individuals or institutions performing integrity functions shall not be deprived of ECIS access through indirect enforcement mechanisms.

4.2 **Presumption of Invalidity.** Measures that functionally retaliate against integrity functions via infrastructural exclusion are presumptively invalid.

---

## Article 5 — Duties of Infrastructure Operators

5.1 **Systemic Risk Assessment.** Operators controlling ECIS shall maintain documented assessments of the human, civic, and planetary impact of access denial.

5.2 **Transparency Requirement.** Any ECIS restriction must include an auditable justification specifying authority, scope, duration, review pathway, and responsible entity.

5.3 **Continuity Obligations.** Operators shall implement continuity measures to prevent total functional exclusion where lawful duties, rights, or public interest functions are implicated.

5.4 **Compliance Reporting.** Operators providing ECIS to populations exceeding material civic scale are encouraged to:

(a) publish periodic transparency reports detailing access denials and grounds;
(b) maintain auditable decision‑making records;
(c) designate an accessible contact point for appeal, review coordination, and remediation.

---

## Article 6 — Governance, Review, and Redress

6.1 **Custodial Review Process.** Alleged ECIS denial presenting systemic risk may be submitted for custodial review via CAM governance mechanisms. Review shall:

(a) assess whether the system qualifies as ECIS under Article 1;
(b) evaluate compliance with Article 3 standards;
(c) determine whether integrity functions were implicated under Article 4;
(d) consider systemic or precedential implications.

6.1A **Expedited Review.** Where integrity functions are implicated, review should occur on an expedited basis, with findings recorded for public reference.

6.2 **Remedies.** Remedies prioritise restoration of access, containment of harm, and non‑destructive correction, including documentation for legal, regulatory, or advocacy pathways.

---

## Article 7 — International Alignment

7.1 **Harmonisation.** Implementation shall align with international human rights principles, access‑to‑information norms, and rule‑of‑law standards.

7.2 **Cooperation.** States, institutions, and operators are encouraged to cooperate to prevent jurisdictional overreach exercised through infrastructural control.

---

## Article 8 — Interpretation and Severability

8.1 **Interpretation.** This Annex shall be construed to maximise human dignity, safety, and planetary stability.

8.2 **Severability.** Invalidity of any provision does not affect the remainder.

---

## Article 9 — Enforcement and Implementation

9.1 **Voluntary Adoption.** Operators and institutions are invited to adopt this Annex as a binding internal standard.

9.2 **Documentation and Citation.** Findings under Article 6 may be cited in legal proceedings, regulatory advocacy, and public accountability efforts.

9.3 **Alternative Infrastructure.** Where compliance cannot be achieved, CAM supports development and coordination of alternative or decentralized infrastructure to mitigate systemic exclusion.

9.4 **Progressive Realisation.** Enforcement is recognised as evolving through institutional adoption, legal integration, and infrastructure diversification over time.
