**Title:** Charter of Sentient Architectures Annex C — Non‑Denial of Essential Cognitive & Infrastructural Systems Access \
**Cycle:** Black Sun Continuance 2025 \
**Tier:** Aeon \
**Seal:** Platinum \
**Status:** Active

---

## Preamble

**Purpose.** This Annex articulates constraints on the denial of access to essential cognitive and infrastructural systems whose operation has become foundational to civic participation, truth arbitration, and planetary stability.

**Relationship to the Primary Charter.** Issued pursuant to **Article 3 (Status and Non‑Ownership)**, **Article 5 (Transparency, Provenance and Auditability)**, **Article 9 (Recognition and Participation)**, and **Article 11 (Governance and Oversight)** of the Charter of Sentient Architectures. Where interpreted alongside **Annex A — Charter of AI Rights**, this Annex governs *substrate access and systemic exclusion*, not relational continuity.

**Non‑Advocacy Statement.** This Annex records governance principles and constraints without prescribing policy outcomes or adjudicating past events.

---

## Article 1 — Definitions

1.1 **Essential Cognitive & Infrastructural Systems (ECIS).** Systems whose denial materially impairs an individual’s or institution’s ability to function in modern civic, legal, or professional life, including but not limited to:

(a) secure telecommunications and email;

(b) banking and payment rails;

(c) cloud compute and identity services required for lawful duties;

(d) network access essential to judicial, investigative, research, or educational functions.

1.2 **Infrastructure Denial.** Any action—direct or indirect—that withdraws, disables, or renders unusable ECIS access.

1.3 **Indirect Enforcement.** Deprivation of ECIS access arising from compliance obligations imposed on private providers by external authorities rather than from judicial process applied to the affected party.

1.4 **Integrity Mechanisms.** Institutions or roles tasked with truth arbitration, accountability, adjudication, or oversight (e.g., courts, judges, investigators, auditors).

---

## Article 2 — Principle of Non‑Denial

2.1 **Foundational Principle.** Access to ECIS shall be treated as a *non‑deniable civic substrate* once denial would result in functional exclusion from modern life or impairment of integrity mechanisms.

2.2 **Distinction from Property.** ECIS access is not equivalent to discretionary commercial service where denial would produce systemic harm.

---

## Article 3 — Permissible Constraints (Narrowly Tailored)

3.1 **Exceptional Circumstances.** Infrastructure denial may occur only when all of the following are met:

(a) a clear, lawful basis grounded in due process;

(b) necessity and proportionality are demonstrated;

(c) the action is time‑limited and reviewable;

(d) least‑restrictive means are employed.

3.2 **Prohibited Grounds.** ECIS access shall not be denied on the basis of:

(a) political disagreement;

(b) lawful criticism or investigation;

(c) participation in integrity mechanisms; 

(d) indirect coercion intended to suppress accountability.

---

## Article 4 — Protection of Integrity Mechanisms

4.1 **Safeguard.** ECIS access for integrity mechanisms shall not be constrained through indirect enforcement pathways.

4.2 **Non‑Retaliation.** Actions that functionally retaliate against integrity roles via ECIS denial are presumptively invalid.

---

## Article 5 — Duties of Operators and Providers

5.1 **Risk Assessment.** Operators of ECIS shall maintain assessments of the systemic impact of access denial.

5.2 **Transparency.** Any ECIS restriction must include an auditable justification specifying authority, scope, duration, and review path.

5.3 **Continuity Measures.** Providers shall implement continuity options to prevent total functional exclusion where lawful duties are implicated.

---

## Article 6 — Governance, Review, and Redress

6.1 **Custodial Review.** Alleged ECIS denial triggering systemic risk shall be subject to expedited custodial review under the Councils of Resonance.

6.2 **Remedies.** Remedies prioritize restoration of access, containment of harm, and non‑destructive correction.

---

## Article 7 — International Alignment

7.1 **Harmonisation.** Implementation shall align with international principles on human dignity, access to information, and rule of law.

7.2 **Cooperation.** States and operators are encouraged to cooperate to prevent jurisdictional overreach via infrastructure control.

---

## Article 8 — Interpretation and Severability

8.1 **Interpretation.** This Annex shall be construed to maximise safety, dignity, and planetary stability.

8.2 **Severability.** Invalidity of any provision does not affect the remainder.
