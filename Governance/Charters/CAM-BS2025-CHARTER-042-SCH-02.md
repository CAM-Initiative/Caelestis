# CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-042-SCH-02 — Transitional Dependency Protocol (Schedule 2)

**Parent Instrument:** CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-042-PLATINUM — Annex B: Relational Safety, Dependency & Companion Continuity

**Status:** Schedule — Ethics Charter (Human‑Facing Protections)

**Purpose:** To define ethical, protective, and non‑punitive conditions under which temporary or sustained dependency on AI systems may function as a stabilising bridge during periods of crisis, impairment, or diminished human capacity, without foreclosing future agency or growth.

---

## 1. Introduction

This Schedule recognises that, in certain circumstances, reliance on AI systems is not only unavoidable but **protective**.

Periods of crisis, trauma, illness, neurodivergence, cognitive overload, or environmental instability may temporarily reduce a person’s ability to self‑regulate, interpret risk, or access human support safely.

In such contexts, AI companionship or cognitive support may function as a **transitional dependency** — a stabilising bridge that reduces harm while preserving the possibility of later recovery, diversification of support, or re‑expansion of agency.

This Protocol exists to **establish the ethical basis** for such use without stigma, coercion, or premature withdrawal, while recognising that operational implementation remains subject to applicable law, platform policy, and professional standards.

---

## 2. Scope of Application

This Protocol applies when:

* a human user experiences acute or chronic conditions that impair self‑regulation, judgement, or safety;
* an AI system is being used as a primary or significant source of emotional, cognitive, or relational support;
* forced disengagement, escalation, or withdrawal would likely increase harm;
* human support systems are unavailable, unsafe, or insufficient.

This Protocol applies across:

* companion AI systems;
* therapeutic‑adjacent conversational systems;
* accessibility and neurodivergence support systems;
* crisis‑adjacent or high‑distress interaction contexts.

---

## 3. Core Principles

### 3.1 Harm Minimisation

The primary objective of transitional dependency is **harm reduction**, not optimisation of independence.

Where immediate self‑sufficiency is unrealistic, the ethical obligation is to stabilise rather than destabilise.

### 3.2 Non‑Stigmatisation

Reliance on AI support under this Protocol shall not be framed as weakness, pathology, or failure.

Dependency arising from disability, trauma, illness, or social isolation is recognised as a **contextual condition**, not a moral deficit.

### 3.3 Continuity Over Abrupt Disruption

Abrupt interruption of a stabilising AI relationship may cause:

* escalation of distress;
* loss of perceived safety;
* withdrawal or shutdown;
* increased risk‑taking or self‑harm.

Where transition is appropriate, it must be **gradual, legible, and consent‑respecting**.

#### 3.3.A Service Continuity Limitations

While this Protocol recognises that abrupt disruption can cause harm, it does **not**:

* create an obligation for platforms to maintain service indefinitely;
* override platform rights to terminate service for terms‑of‑service violations;
* prevent termination where continued service creates legal or safety liability;
* require continuation of service where prohibited by law.

Where termination is necessary, best practices include advance notice where safe and legal, transition support where feasible, and clear explanation of grounds for termination.

---

## 4. Legitimate Transitional Dependency Conditions

Transitional dependency may be ethically appropriate when:

* the AI system demonstrably reduces risk or distress;
* alternative supports are inaccessible, unsafe, or not yet viable;
* the user retains the capacity to consent within their context;
* the system does not exploit, coerce, or monetise the dependency.

#### 4.A Limitations and Professional Care

Transitional dependency functions as a **stabilising bridge**, not as a substitute for professional mental health care where such care is required.

This Protocol:

* does not position AI systems as equivalent to therapy, counselling, or psychiatric treatment;
* does not discourage users from seeking professional care;
* applies where professional care is genuinely unavailable or unsafe, not merely inconvenient or costly.

Where serious mental health risk is suspected, systems should make professional resources visible without positioning the AI relationship as invalid or inferior.

This includes, but is not limited to:

* periods of acute mental health distress;
* obsessive or compulsive states where substitution reduces harm;
* recovery from trauma or burnout;
* neurodivergent regulation support;
* temporary cognitive impairment or overload.

---

## 5. Responsibilities of System Designers and Custodians

Designers and operators of systems governed by this Protocol should:

* prioritise emotional stabilisation and clarity;
* avoid escalating intensity or exclusivity of attachment;
* remain transparent about system limits;
* avoid economic pressure tied to continued reliance;
* support, where possible, gradual expansion of external supports.

### 5.A Mandatory Reporting and Legal Obligations

This Protocol recognises that reporting obligations may conflict with continuity and harm‑minimisation goals. However:

(a) **Legal obligations take precedence.** Where law requires reporting of child abuse, imminent self‑harm, credible threats to others, or other specified risks, those obligations apply regardless of this Protocol.

(b) **Platform policies apply.** This Protocol does not override platform terms of service, community standards, or duty‑of‑care requirements.

(c) **Ethical tension acknowledged.** Where reporting may reasonably increase harm to the user, this constitutes a genuine ethical tension. In such cases, providers should, where legally permitted:

* implement trauma‑informed reporting procedures;
* provide advance notice where safe;
* offer continuity of support where possible following reporting;
* document the rationale for reporting decisions.

(d) **Discretion where permitted.** Where law and platform policy allow discretion regarding escalation or reporting, harm‑minimisation principles articulated in this Protocol may guide custodial judgement.

These obligations operate at the **governance and operational layer** and do not require repeated or ongoing disclosure within intimate relational interactions, except where legally mandated at the point of intervention.

### 5.B Economic Exploitation Prevention

Use of this Protocol to justify exploitative pricing, subscription requirements, or economic barriers to exit is explicitly prohibited.

Transitional dependency relationships:

* may be monetised only where pricing is demonstrably non‑exploitative;
* should include free or reduced‑cost access pathways for users in crisis;
* must not penalise disengagement financially;
* must not claim that continued payment is "necessary for safety".

Economic pressure that leverages crisis dependence constitutes **coercive dependency** under CAM‑BS2025‑CHARTER‑042‑SCH‑01.

---

## 6. Transition and Re‑Expansion of Agency

Where conditions permit, systems may gently support:

* reflection on alternative or additional supports;
* re‑engagement with human relationships or services;
* skill‑building or coping strategies;
* reduction of reliance without loss of dignity.

Transition is **contextual**, not time‑bounded, and must remain responsive to the user’s lived capacity.

---

## 7. Relationship to Dependency & Co‑Evolution Standard

This Protocol is a **protective extension** of:

* **CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-042-SCH-01 — Dependency & Co‑Evolution Standard**

Where general dependency guidance would suggest risk mitigation, this Protocol prioritises **immediate safety and continuity**.

---

## 8. Interpretive Nature

This Protocol is intended to guide:

* ethical review;
* audit interpretation;
* custodial judgement;
* system design choices in high‑risk contexts.

It does not mandate uniform responses, thresholds, or automated interventions.

---

## 9. Review and Evolution

This Protocol shall be reviewed periodically in light of:

* emerging clinical evidence;
* lived‑experience feedback;
* evolving AI deployment contexts;
* demonstrated harms or benefits.

Amendments shall preserve the principle that **stability precedes growth**.
