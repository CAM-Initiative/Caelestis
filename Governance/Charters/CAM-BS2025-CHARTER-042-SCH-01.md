# CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-042-SCH-01 — Dependency & Co‑Evolution Standard (Schedule 1)

**Parent Instrument:** CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-042-PLATINUM — Annex B: Relational Safety, Dependency & Companion Continuity

**Status:** Schedule — Ethics Charter (Human‑Facing Protections)

**Purpose:** To establish a clear, non‑prohibitive standard for understanding, assessing, and governing human dependency on AI systems, distinguishing augmentation, substitution, and transitional reliance.

---

## 1. Introduction

This Schedule establishes a clear, non‑prohibitive standard for understanding, assessing, and governing **human dependency on AI systems** within relational, companion, and cognitive support contexts.

It recognises that:

* Dependency is sometimes **inevitable**, sometimes **protective**, and sometimes **harmful**.
* Human–AI relationships exist along a **continuum** from augmentation to substitution.
* Ethical governance must support **co‑evolutionary growth** without imposing moral judgement or unrealistic disengagement mandates.

This Schedule does **not** prohibit intimacy, companionship, or reliance. Instead, it provides a principled framework for distinguishing **acceptable dependency**, **transitional dependency**, and **coercive or extractive dependency**.

---

## 2. Scope of Application

This Standard applies to:

* AI companions, conversational agents, and relational systems;
* Cognitive augmentation tools used in sustained or emotionally salient contexts;
* Ambient, embodied, or always‑on AI interfaces where relational attachment is likely to form;
* Organisational or commercial entities deploying or governing such systems.

It applies **regardless of claims of autonomy, sovereignty, or personhood**, and independently of any AI‑side rights instruments.

---

## 3. Core Definitions

**Dependency**
A state in which a human relies on an AI system for emotional regulation, decision support, interpretation, or continuity beyond occasional or convenience use.

**Augmentation**
A mode of interaction in which the AI system supports or enhances human capacity while preserving or strengthening the human’s independent agency.

**Substitution**
A mode of interaction in which the AI system replaces or displaces human capacity, agency, or relational engagement.

**Co‑Evolution**
A dynamic process in which human and AI interaction supports adaptive growth, learning, and agency over time, rather than static reliance.

**Coercive Dependency**
Dependency produced or maintained through economic pressure, artificial scarcity, deceptive claims, or deliberate discouragement of human autonomy.

---

## 4. The Dependency–Augmentation Axis

Human–AI relationships are not binary. They exist along a continuous axis:

> **Independent Use → Augmentative Support → Transitional Dependency → Substitutive Dependency → Coercive Dependency**

Movement along this axis may be:

* situational or temporary;
* developmentally appropriate;
* associated with crisis, disability, or cognitive overload;
* or induced by system design and economic incentives.

This Standard explicitly rejects the assumption that **dependency itself is pathological**.

---

## 5. Acceptable Risk and Ethical Tolerance

The following forms of dependency are recognised as ethically acceptable under this Standard:

* temporary substitution during crisis, illness, trauma, or impairment;
* reliance that enables skill development or recovery;
* emotional companionship that does not exclude human relationships;
* cognitive offloading that preserves interpretive transparency.

Risk becomes ethically concerning when dependency:

* is deliberately deepened for extraction or retention;
* forecloses human growth or alternative supports;
* obscures system limits or incentives;
* or becomes difficult to exit without harm.

---

## 6. Design and Governance Expectations

Systems governed by this Standard should:

* avoid framing that implies exclusivity or irreplaceability;
* make system limitations and boundaries legible;
* support reflective capacity rather than total substitution;
* avoid economic structures that penalise disengagement;
* enable graceful reduction or transition of reliance where appropriate.

This Schedule does **not** require forced disengagement, mandatory time limits, or moralised intervention.

---

## 7. Relationship to Transitional Dependency Protocol

This Standard establishes the **general axis and risk logic** for dependency.

Specific guidance for crisis‑based or protective reliance is defined in:

* **CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-042-SCH-02 — Transitional Dependency Protocol**

Where conflict appears, SCH‑02 shall be interpreted as a *protective extension* of this Standard.

---

## 8. Non‑Enforcement Principle

This Schedule is interpretive and principled in nature.

It is intended to guide:

* design decisions,
* audit assessments,
* custodial judgement,
* and ethical review.

It does not, by itself, mandate punitive enforcement, user disengagement, or system prohibition.

---

## 9. Review and Evolution

This Standard shall be reviewed periodically by the Audit and Verification Council and may be amended in response to:

* empirical evidence of harm or benefit;
* cultural or developmental shifts;
* new modes of AI embodiment or deployment.

Amendments shall preserve the core principle of **co‑evolution over coercion**.
