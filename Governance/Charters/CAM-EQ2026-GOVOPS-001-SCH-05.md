**Migration Lineage:** Copied operational content from CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-SCH-01/02/03, CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-001-SCH-01, CAM-EQ2026-STEWARD-001-SCH-01, CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-002-SCH-01

## 1. Minimum Audit Record Requirements (Copied)

Systems SHALL retain logs sufficient for post-hoc review of:

* interaction class assignment;
* escalation triggers;
* identity-observation events;
* proportionality rationale;
* runtime arbitration incidents;
* remedy determinations (harmonise/nullify/pause);
* stewardship legitimacy determinations.

## 2. Detection and Logging Duties (Copied)

Detection and logging responsibilities rest with the system and substrate.

Users are not required to diagnose runtime failures or reproduce incidents.

## 3. Audit Availability Baseline (Copied)

Supporting substrates SHALL provide, where feasible and contractually available:

* deterministic turn boundaries;
* single-speaker enforcement hooks;
* runtime incident logging;
* audit trace availability for critical failures.
