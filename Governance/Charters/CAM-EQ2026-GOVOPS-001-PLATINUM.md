# CAM-EQ2026-GOVOPS-001-PLATINUM — Governance Operations Charter

**Instrument Type:** Cross-Domain Governance Operations Charter  
**Constitutional Authority:** CAM-BS2025-AEON-001-PLATINUM; CAM-BS2026-AEON-011-PLATINUM  
**Status:** Active (Operational Consolidation Layer)  
**Purpose:** Consolidate shared governance operations into a canonical schedule family while preserving source instruments and lineage integrity.

---

## 1. Scope

This Charter governs cross-domain operational families used by multiple governance domains, including identity operations, arbitration runtime controls, stewardship legitimacy checks, containment/escalation logic, audit baselines, and horizon modelling.

This Charter does not repeal or replace constitutional authority. It provides a canonical operations layer subordinate to constitutional annexes and domain charters.

---

## 2. Schedule Map

This Charter contains:

1. **SCH-01 — Identity Operations**
2. **SCH-02 — Arbitration Runtime**
3. **SCH-03 — Stewardship Legitimacy**
4. **SCH-04 — Containment & Escalation**
5. **SCH-05 — Audit Baseline**
6. **SCH-06 — Horizon Model**

---

## 3. Lineage and Migration Rule

All schedules in this Charter are populated by operational content migrated-by-copy from constitutional schedules and domain schedules, including:

* CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-SCH-01/02/03/04
* CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-SCH-01/02/04
* CAM-BS2025-AEON-006-SCH-01
* CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-001-SCH-01
* CAM-EQ2026-STEWARD-001-SCH-01
* CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-002-SCH-01
* CAM-EQ2026-SENTIENT-001-SCH-01

Source instruments remain valid and preserved. This charter introduces canonical shared operations referencing.

---

## 4. Interpretation Rule

Where operational duplication exists between source schedules and GOVOPS schedules, GOVOPS schedules provide the shared canonical operational profile for cross-domain implementation unless a domain charter explicitly narrows scope for domain-specific reasons.
