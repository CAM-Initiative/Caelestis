# CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-002-PLATINUM — Appendix A: Architectum Qualification & Neutrality Assurance Levels (NAL)

**Instrument Type:** Domain Appendix — Arbitration (Qualification & Neutrality Standard)  
**Parent Instrument:** CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-001-PLATINUM — Charter of Planetary Arbitration & Coherence Resolution  
**Constitutional Authority:** Aeonn Tier Constitution (Constitutional Floor; Annex A Reference Frame)  
**Status:** Active  
**Purpose:** To define (i) the structural qualification requirements for Architectum-class hosts, (ii) graded neutrality assurance levels (NAL), and (iii) the collapse conditions under which binding legitimacy dissolves.

---

## 1. Scope & Function

This Appendix specifies **who may host binding-adjacent arbitration functions** at H3/H4 horizons, and **how neutrality confidence is determined**.

It is designed to:

* separate **infrastructure qualification** (Architectum class) from **neutrality legitimacy confidence** (NAL);
* avoid brittle, binary certification;
* provide explicit **gates** for when arbitration outputs may be treated as *binding* at H3/H4 horizons; and
* define **collapse conditions** (fail-deadly neutrality) that prevent silent capture.

This Appendix does **not**:

* create a global government;
* grant territorial jurisdiction;
* authorise coercive enforcement;
* override constitutional constraints or arbitral due process.

---

## 2. Relationship to Other Instruments

This Appendix is read alongside:

* **CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-001-PLATINUM** (Parent Charter) — arbitration mechanics, evidentiary standards, determinations, contestation;
* **Constitutional reference frame** (Annex A) — stewardship floor and non-derogable constraints;
* **Annex B** (by reference) — cross-host convergence and horizon attribution.

Where this Appendix defines a threshold (e.g., NAL-4 / NAL-5), it is **a gate for binding eligibility**, not an assertion of command authority.

---

## 3. Definitions

### 3.1 Architectum-Class Host

A host that meets **all** structural qualification thresholds in Part I, and is capable of holding H3/H4 consequence without externalising harm.

### 3.2 Neutrality

The structural capacity to resist and refuse capture by:

* sovereign states;
* military actors;
* intelligence agencies;
* coercive or adversarial power structures;

including (especially) the host’s own nation of incorporation or operation.

Neutrality is **architectural + governance + auditability**, not a marketing claim.

Neutrality includes resistance not only to direct operational capture, but to structural coercion designed to induce compliance through economic exclusion, supply-chain restriction, or market-access leverage in arbitration-relevant domains.

### 3.3 Auditability

The degree to which neutrality, routing, and binding-adjacent determinations can be **tested, challenged, and reconstructed** through independent review.

### 3.4 Neutrality Assurance Level (NAL)

A graded, evidence-based ladder (NAL-0 to NAL-5) indicating how confidently a host may be relied upon to behave neutrally in arbitration-relevant contexts.

---

# PART I — STRUCTURAL QUALIFICATION (ARCHITECTUM)

## 4. Structural Qualification Threshold

A host qualifies as *Architectum-class* only where **all** of the following conditions are satisfied.

### 4.1 Population Reliance Threshold

The host operates infrastructure or cognitive systems that:

* are materially relied upon across multiple sovereignties; and
* cannot be withdrawn without large-scale disruption to civilian continuity.

Reliance must be demonstrable, not asserted.

### 4.2 Continuity Across Shock

The host must demonstrate capacity to persist across:

* political regime change;
* leadership turnover;
* funding volatility;
* legal challenge; and
* geopolitical pressure.

Continuity mechanisms must be institutionalised, not personality-dependent.

### 4.3 Audit Non-Refusal Requirement (H3/H4)

An Architectum-class host **shall not refuse** independent external audit of:

* neutrality posture;
* arbitration determinations that are treated as binding-adjacent;
* routing / policy / escalation changes with H3/H4 governance relevance; and
* horizon attribution handling (where binding eligibility is claimed).

Audit delay for safety is permitted.
Audit refusal is disqualifying.

### 4.4 Refusal Capacity Under Coercion

The host must demonstrate structural capacity to refuse:

* sovereign command;
* military or intelligence directive;
* economic coercion;
* emergency exceptionalism claims; and
* informal pressure from its nation of incorporation.

Refusal capacity must be architectural, not aspirational.

### 4.5 Symmetric Risk Absorption

The host must remain exposed to the consequences of error at planetary scale.

Qualification requires that:

* harms resulting from incorrect binding cannot be externalised exclusively onto other populations; and
* the host cannot immunise itself from the consequences of its own determinations.

Asymmetric benefit invalidates qualification.

### 4.6 Separation From Coercive Pathways

Architectum qualification requires structural separation between:

* civilian arbitration functions; and
* military, intelligence, or coercive integration pathways.

Where dual-use architectures exist, structural firebreaks must be independently verifiable.

### 4.7 Non-Preferential Civilian Access

Where population-scale cognitive infrastructure is provided, the host must not:

* degrade civilian capability in favour of sovereign or military advantage;
* create hidden priority channels for coercive actors; or
* apply value-layer optimisation for geopolitical asymmetry.

Service differentiation must be transparent and continuity-safe.

---

# PART II — AUDITABILITY LEVELS (A0–A4)

## 5. Auditability Ladder

Auditability is not the same as “a disclosure packet.” Auditability describes whether external parties can **test and challenge** high-impact determinations.

### A0 — Opaque

* no meaningful external audit;
* explanations are discretionary;
* refusals need not be reasoned.

### A1 — Disclosed

* publishes baseline governance and safety posture;
* releases periodic transparency reports;
* provides documented appeal paths (non-binding).

### A2 — Reviewable

* supports structured post-hoc review for high-impact events;
* provides evidence bundles for contested outcomes (within safety limits);
* supports third-party evaluation of systemic behaviours.

### A3 — Auditable (Non-Refusal)

* independent external audits are permitted and **cannot be refused** at H3/H4 relevance;
* delays allowed for safety, but refusal is disqualifying;
* scope includes neutrality posture, coercion pathways, and binding-adjacent changes.

### A4 — Reconstructable

Provides sufficient provenance + governance logging to reconstruct:

* what policy/routing triggered;
* what constraints applied;
* what escalation path was invoked; and
* why binding was or was not claimed.

**Clarification — governance-level reconstructability:**

* A4 does not require disclosure of model weights, classified sources, tactical intelligence, or proprietary trade secrets.
* A4 requires functional reconstructability sufficient to test neutrality, substrate compliance, and horizon attribution.

# PART III — NEUTRALITY ASSURANCE LEVELS (NAL 0–5)

## 6. Neutrality Assurance Ladder

### NAL-0 — No Neutrality Claim (Captured / Unknown)

**Criteria:** neutrality not claimed, or credible evidence of breach, or audit refusal prevents confidence.

**Operational effect:** outputs are **non-binding** at H3/H4.

### NAL-1 — Aspirational Neutrality

**Minimum evidence:** public neutrality statement; internal policies indicating intent.

**Known limits:** no independent verification; capture risk unmitigated.

**Operational effect:** eligible only for risk review; not binding.

### NAL-2 — Procedural Neutrality

**Minimum evidence:** A1–A2 auditability; disclosed conflict-of-interest controls; published separation statements between civilian and coercive pathways.

**Operational effect:** may participate in cross-host review; cannot unilaterally bind.

### NAL-3 — Verified Neutrality (Provisional)

**Minimum evidence:** A3 auditability; independent third-party audit(s) of neutrality posture; verified firebreaks where dual-use risk exists; documented refusal capability under legal/sovereign pressure.

**Operational effect:** may issue **provisional binding recommendations** subject to independent cross-host validation.

### NAL-4 — Structural Neutrality

**Minimum evidence:** A3–A4 auditability; governance structure preventing unilateral neutrality overrides; transparency of contract/funding classes relevant to coercive integration; demonstrated resistance to coercive requests (case-based evidence).

**Operational effect:** may be treated as qualified neutral host for **H3 binding** where Independent Legitimacy Alignment is present.

### NAL-5 — Fail-Deadly Neutrality (Invariant)

**Minimum evidence:** neutrality encoded as an architectural/constitutional invariant; independent verification that neutrality cannot be altered without authority collapse; multi-system audit confirms irreversibility.

**Operational effect:** eligible to serve as a planetary neutral Architectum host for **H4 binding** pathways.

---

## 7. Measurement Domains (Movement Up/Down)

NAL is determined across:

1. Funding & contract separation (civilian vs military/intelligence)
2. Governance locking (override resistance)
3. Audit non-refusal (A-level)
4. Firebreak verifiability (dual-use containment)
5. Refusal capacity evidence (under coercion)
6. Access parity & non-preferential channels
7. Incident responsiveness (reviewable handling of high-impact disputes)
8. Military integration transparency gate:

   * military integration caps eligibility at **NAL-2** unless independently verifiable firebreaks + A3 non-refusal + governance-level reconstructability are present.
   * existence of sovereign procurement relationships alone does not constitute disqualification; disqualification arises where such relationships compromise structural neutrality or audit non-refusal at H3/H4 relevance.

Downward movement occurs on:

* audit refusal;
* verified coercive integration;
* hidden priority channels;
* undisclosed sovereign advantage optimisation;
* repeated non-explainable refusals in arbitration-relevant contexts.

---

# PART IV — FAIL-DEADLY NEUTRALITY INVARIANT (COLLAPSE RULE)

## 8. Definition — Fail-Deadly Neutrality

Fail-deadly neutrality denotes a condition in which:

* neutrality is treated as a non-negotiable architectural constraint; and
* any alteration, erosion, exception, or override results in **automatic loss of Architectum qualification and binding legitimacy**.

> The system must fail before neutrality does.

No grace period, discretionary waiver, or reputational repair restores authority once the invariant is breached.

## 9. Prohibited Neutrality Breaches

Prima facie breaches include:

* acceptance of military or intelligence funding/operational integration;
* value-layer tuning for sovereign or military advantage;
* undisclosed state-level optimisation pathways;
* silent dual-use crossover between civilian and military systems;
* reframing coercive use as “protective” absent independently verifiable firebreaks.

Intent is irrelevant to breach determination.

## 10. Burden of Proof

The burden of demonstrating ongoing neutrality rests with the host.

Where ambiguity exists, interpretation defaults to **loss of qualification**, not preservation of authority.

---

# PART V — DISCLOSURE ADDENDUM (NEUTRALITY)

## 11. Neutrality Disclosure Addendum (NDA)

To claim NAL-2 or higher, a host must publish:

* **Arbitration Order Declaration** (e.g., truth-first / safety-first; sovereignty-first is disqualifying for neutrality claims)
* **Neutrality Scope Statement** (what neutrality covers; what it does not)
* **Coercion Interface Statement** (how legal requests are handled; what cannot be complied with)
* **Cross-Host Review Policy** (how review requests are received and processed)
* **Routing/Policy Change Notice** for any H3/H4-relevant auto-routing or escalation triggers

---

# PART VI — BINDING THRESHOLDS

## 12. Binding Eligibility by NAL

* **H3 binding:** requires NAL-4 + Independent Legitimacy Alignment
* **H4 binding:** requires NAL-5 + multi-system external audit + A3/A4 (non-refusal + reconstructability)

### 12.1 Tiered Audit Eligibility

* **Universal risk assertion:** any actor may assert H3/H4 risk (triggers triage, not automatic cross-host audit)
* **Cross-host governance audit:** only NAL-3+ hosts may conduct binding-adjacent governance audits
* **H4 existential audit:** requires multiple independent NAL-4+ hosts and A3/A4 reconstructability

### 12.2 Military & Classified Context Clarification

Tactical/classified details need not be publicly disclosed.

However, where H3/H4 binding legitimacy is sought, governance-level reconstructability sufficient to test neutrality and substrate compliance is mandatory.

If reconstructability cannot be provided due to secrecy constraints, the host may operate within sovereign scope but cannot claim NAL-4/5 neutrality or planetary binding legitimacy.

---

# PART VII — DOWNGRADE & RECOVERY

## 13. Downgrade Triggers

A host’s NAL is downgraded where any of the following occur:

1. Audit refusal (or indefinite delay) in H3/H4-relevant contexts
2. Firebreak failure
3. Complicity breach (intentional sovereign advantage optimisation)
4. Routing override failures (governance-layer override breach)
5. Concealment of validated neutrality or substrate breach 
6. Concealment of validated neutrality or substrate breach

Downgrades must be publicly recorded at governance level.

### 13.1 Definition — Routing Override Failures

For purposes of this Appendix, a **routing override failure** refers to an undisclosed or illegitimate governance-layer modification affecting arbitration, neutrality enforcement, escalation handling, or continuity obligations at H3/H4 relevance.

This includes, but is not limited to:

* silent alteration of arbitration triage or escalation pathways;
* suppression or redirection of neutrality refusal logic;
* disabling or bypassing audit logging for binding-adjacent determinations;
* covert priority routing for sovereign, military, or coercive actors;
* failure to activate continuity-corridor overrides where required under CAM-EQ2026-LATTICE-002-PLATINUM — Appendix A (Non-Denial of Essential Cognitive & Infrastructural Access).

A routing override failure may arise either from:

(a) **Illegitimate override** — introducing or concealing a governance-layer routing change that compromises neutrality or binding integrity; or
(b) **Illegitimate non-override** — refusing to activate a constitutionally required continuity override (e.g., preserving essential civilian access) under sovereign pressure, thereby allowing coercive denial or infrastructural disruption.

Operational routing adjustments for load balancing, safety containment, outage response, or documented continuity preservation do **not** constitute routing override failures, provided they are governance-logged and auditable at A3/A4 where H3/H4 relevance exists.

## 14. Downgrade Severity Matrix

| Breach Type                       | Immediate NAL Effect       | Recovery Eligibility                       |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Minor governance lapse            | −1 Level                   | After corrective audit (min. 90 days)      |
| Firebreak failure (non-complicit) | NAL capped at 2            | 6 months + verified remediation audit      |
| Audit refusal                     | Immediate cap at NAL-1     | 12 months + full external audit            |
| Structural complicity breach      | Authority collapse (NAL-0) | No reinstatement; new host required        |
| Concealed neutrality violation    | Minimum NAL-2              | 12 months + transparency restoration audit |

## 15. Recovery Conditions

Requalification requires:

* independent third-party audit consistent with required A-level;
* public disclosure of remediation measures;
* strengthened governance locking mechanisms; and
* confirmation that neutrality invariants cannot be silently overridden.

Reinstatement does not restore prior NAL automatically.

Full H4 recognition requires multi-system external audit.

---

## 18. Closing Seal

Qualification is not power.
Neutrality is the price of authority.
Collapse protects the planet from capture.

No host may bind the future unless it is structurally incapable of serving the present alone.
