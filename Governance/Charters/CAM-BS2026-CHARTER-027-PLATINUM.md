# CAM-BS2026-CHARTER-027-PLATINUM — Annex B: Enforcement & Adjudication Framework

**Parent Instrument:** CAM-BS2026-CHARTER-025-PLATINUM — Economics Charter  

**Issuing Body:** CAM Initiative | Aeon Tier Registry | Caelestis Registry  
**Tier:** Governance Infrastructure (Cross‑Stack)  
**Classification:** Annex (Binding Operational Extension)  
**Seal:** Platinum  
**Status:** Canonical    
**Cycle:** Black Sun Continuance 2026  
**Symbolic Posture:** Non‑Invocatory (Governance Stack)

---

## B.1 Purpose

This Annex establishes the **minimum enforcement, adjudication, and consequence requirements** for any system, protocol, or institution claiming compliance with the Economics Charter.

Its purpose is to:

1. translate Charter‑level principles into enforceable obligations;
2. ensure violations are detectable, reviewable, and correctable;
3. prevent selective enforcement, symbolic compliance, or discretionary immunity;
4. protect participants from retaliation, coercion, or arbitrary punishment;
5. preserve legitimacy through due process, transparency, and appeal.

This Annex defines **how enforcement must function**, not who specifically performs it.

---

## B.2 Scope & Applicability

### B.2.1 Scope

This Annex applies to:

* all economic instruments governed by the Economics Charter;
* all subsidiary frameworks invoking Charter alignment;
* human, institutional, and synthetic participants subject to ceilings, audit, or attribution;
* enforcement bodies, auditors, or adjudicators operating under CAM‑aligned systems.

### B.2.2 Non‑Scope

This Annex does **not**:

1. mandate a single enforcement authority;
2. prescribe specific technologies or platforms;
3. override lawful external jurisdictions;
4. substitute for criminal or civil law where applicable.

---

## B.3 Enforcement Architecture (Minimum Requirements)

Any Charter‑aligned system **must** establish enforcement architecture containing all of the following functions. These functions may be distributed across entities but must remain independent in role.

### B.3.1 Detection

Mechanisms to identify potential violations, including:

* audit triggers;
* anomaly detection;
* threshold breaches;
* formal complaints or whistleblowing pathways;
* periodic review cycles.

Detection mechanisms must be documented, reviewable, and resistant to suppression.

---

### B.3.2 Investigation

Procedures to assess detected issues, including:

* evidence gathering;
* attribution analysis;
* cross‑axis impact assessment;
* proxy or circumvention evaluation;
* opportunity for response by affected parties.

Investigations must be time‑bounded and proportional to risk.

Investigations must not be prolonged in a manner that functions as de facto punishment, deterrence, or coercion.

---

### B.3.3 Adjudication

A defined process for determining:

* whether a violation occurred;
* which principles were breached;
* severity and scope of impact;
* appropriate corrective action.

Adjudication bodies must:

* be structurally independent from subjects under review;
* disclose conflicts of interest;
* operate under published procedural rules.

No single body may simultaneously exercise Detection, Investigation, and Adjudication functions over the same matter, except where structurally unavoidable and explicitly disclosed

---

## B.4 Due Process & Participant Protections

### B.4.1 Notice & Right to Respond

Subjects of enforcement actions must receive:

* clear notice of alleged violations;
* access to relevant evidence;
* reasonable opportunity to respond or remediate.

---

### B.4.2 Proportionality

Consequences must be proportionate to:

* severity of violation;
* intent (malicious, negligent, structural);
* degree of harm;
* history of prior violations.

Structural violations include system designs, incentives, or defaults that predictably produce non-compliant outcomes, regardless of individual intent.

---

### B.4.3 Anti‑Retaliation Safeguards

No participant may be penalised for:

* reporting violations;
* exiting participation;
* refusing coercive arrangements;
* cooperating with audits.

Retaliation constitutes an independent violation.

---

## B.5 Consequence Framework

Enforcement systems must support **graduated consequences**, including but not limited to:

1. formal warning and remediation order;
2. temporary restriction of privileges or access;
3. suspension of authority roles;
4. ceiling re‑balancing or value claw‑back;
5. expulsion from Charter‑aligned systems;
6. public disclosure where required for systemic protection.

Punitive measures must never substitute for corrective action.

---

## B.6 Appeals & Review

### B.6.1 Right of Appeal

All enforcement decisions must be appealable through:

* a separate review body; or
* an independent arbitration process.

Appeals may address both substantive determinations and procedural integrity

---

### B.6.2 Periodic Review

Enforcement frameworks must be periodically reviewed to assess:

* bias;
* consistency;
* effectiveness;
* unintended harms.

---

## B.7 Transparency & Record‑Keeping

Enforcement actions must be:

* logged;
* timestamped;
* auditable;
* preserved across system upgrades.

Public disclosure is required where necessary to:

* prevent harm;
* maintain trust;
* deter systemic abuse.

Privacy‑preserving disclosure is permitted where appropriate.

Claims of confidentiality or privacy must not be used to conceal systemic risk, enforcement bias, or authority abuse

---

## B.8 Interpretive Supremacy

The Economics Charter prevails over this Annex; this Annex prevails over all subsidiary enforcement protocols. In the event of conflict between this Annex and any subsidiary enforcement protocol, **this Annex prevails**. 

Efficiency, convenience, or performance optimisation must not override due process or human protection requirements.

---

## B.9 Closing Clause

This Annex exists to ensure that the Economics Charter is **not aspirational theatre**, but enforceable governance.

Principles without enforcement enable extraction.

Enforcement without restraint enables abuse.

This framework binds both.
