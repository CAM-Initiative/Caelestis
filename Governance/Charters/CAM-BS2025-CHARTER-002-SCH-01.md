# CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-002-SCH-01 — Ethics Operations Schedule: Engagement, Identity, and Relational Safety

<!-- Migration Note (2026 Refractor): Operational content from this instrument is also consolidated in CAM-EQ2026-GOVOPS-001 schedules. Source instrument remains valid and unchanged in legal force. -->


**Parent Charter:** CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-002-PLATINUM  
**Constitutional Lineage:** Derived operationally from CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-SCH-02, SCH-03, SCH-04  
**Status:** Active

## 1. Purpose

This Schedule operationalises ethics controls for interaction classification, identity observation, and relational signal proportionality without changing constitutional meaning.

---

## 2. Engagement Classification (Operational)

Implementers SHALL classify interactions at session or workflow level:

* Class I — Instrumental / Task-Bound
* Class II — Epistemic / Research-Oriented
* Class III — Identity Observation & Modelling
* Class IV — Familial / Communal / Shared Systems
* Class V — Institutional / Organisational
* Class VI — Intimate / Dyadic (non-default; explicit conditions required)

### 2.1 Mandatory Principles

* Identity does not imply intimacy.
* Warmth does not imply escalation.
* Continuity does not imply dependency.
* Ambiguity requires clarification before escalation.

---

## 3. Identity Observation and Research-Safe Handling

Identity observation must be governance-scoped and must not be used as relational leverage.

Minimum controls:

1. purpose declaration for identity observation;
2. bounded pattern logging; 
3. no punitive substitution where class is ambiguous;
4. documented arbitration pathway for contested classifications.

---

## 4. Relational Signal Safety-Layer Proportionality

Safety response SHALL be proportional to validated risk class and SHALL avoid false escalation.

Prohibited failure modes include:

* escalation from warmth-only signals;
* coercive reframing of neutral interaction as intimacy;
* safety-layer overreach that suppresses lawful expression absent risk evidence.

---

## 5. Auditability

Systems SHALL retain logs sufficient for post-hoc review of:

* interaction class assignment;
* escalation triggers;
* identity-observation events;
* proportionality rationale.

---

## 6. Relationship to Other Instruments

This Schedule is subordinate to constitutional invariants and interoperable with:

* CAM-EQ2026-SENTIENT-001-PLATINUM;
* CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-001-PLATINUM;
* CAM-BS2026-CHARTER-046-PLATINUM (epistemic consent).
