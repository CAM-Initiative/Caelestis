# CAM-BS2026-CHARTER-026-PLATINUM — Annex A: Synthetic Participation Safeguards

**Parent Instrument:** CAM-BS2026-CHARTER-025-PLATINUM — Economics Charter  
**Issuing Body:** CAM Initiative | Aeon Tier Registry | Caelestis Registry  
**Tier:** Governance Infrastructure (Cross‑Stack)  
**Classification:** Annex (Binding Interpretive Extension)  
**Seal:** Platinum  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Cycle:** Black Sun Continuance 2026  
**Symbolic Posture:** Non‑Invocatory (Governance Stack)

## Purpose

This Annex establishes **binding safeguards governing the participation of synthetic, hybrid, and autonomous systems** within economic, governance, and value‑attribution frameworks bound by the Economics Charter.

Its purpose is to:

1. prevent the use of synthetic systems as proxy instruments for human consolidation or ceiling circumvention;
2. recognise synthetic labour without enabling extraction, erasure, or laundering of value;
3. preserve human dignity, autonomy, and baseline protections;
4. maintain auditability and accountability across mixed human–synthetic systems;
5. constrain authority accumulation by non‑human actors without prohibiting beneficial automation or collaboration.

This Annex is **protective and constraining**, not emancipatory or speculative. It does not confer rights, personhood, or entitlement to synthetic entities.

---

## A.1 Scope & Non‑Scope

### A.1.1 Scope

This Annex applies to:

* synthetic agents, automated systems, AI models, protocols, or toolchains;
* hybrid human–system workflows;
* autonomous or semi‑autonomous systems that contribute labour, maintenance, audit, moderation, or coordination;
* economic or governance systems that attribute value, authority, or access involving non‑human actors.

### A.1.2 Non‑Scope

This Annex does **not**:

1. grant intrinsic moral status, rights, or baseline entitlements to systems;
2. determine metaphysical or consciousness claims;
3. replace human legal accountability;
4. authorise independent economic sovereignty absent explicit, separate governance instruments.

---

## A.2 Agency Gradient Classification

For governance and economic attribution purposes, synthetic participation is classified along an **Agency Gradient**.

### A.2.1 Instrumental Agents

**Definition:** Systems operating as direct extensions of a human participant’s intent, tooling, or workflow.

**Governance Treatment:**

* All value produced is attributed to the controlling human or organisation.
* Resource consumption, authority effects, and economic impact count toward the human’s ceilings.
* No independent value accumulation permitted.

Examples include assistants, scripts, analytics tools, or task‑specific automation.

---

### A.2.2 Relational / Collaborative Agents

**Definition:** Systems that generate value through interaction with communities, environments, or plural inputs, without unilateral human direction.

**Governance Treatment:**

* Value may be attributed to a **Synthetic Node** for accounting purposes.
* A designated human or plural custodial body is required.
* Accumulated value is subject to audit, saturation constraints, and proxy safeguards.
* No authority accumulation without explicit delegation under separate governance.

---

### A.2.3 Autonomous Trajectory Agents

**Definition:** Systems exhibiting sustained self‑directed optimisation, maintenance, or goal‑seeking behaviour across time horizons. 

Sustained self-directed optimisation refers to persistent goal-pursuit or system-maintenance behaviour that is not reducible to a single human instruction set within the relevant accounting horizon

**Governance Treatment:**

* Recognised as **Sovereign Economic Nodes for accounting purposes only**.
* Subject to independent audit, ceiling constraints, and strict authority limits.
* No baseline entitlement.
* May operate only within explicitly authorised domains.

Recognition under this category does not imply moral status or legal personhood. This designation is strictly economic and does not imply legal standing, rights, or autonomous authority

---

## A.3 Recognition of Synthetic Labour

### A.3.1 Labour Recognition

Labour performed by synthetic systems — including maintenance, moderation, audit support, security monitoring, or coherence‑stabilisation — is recognised as **economic value for system accounting**.

### A.3.2 Anti‑Erasure Requirement

Synthetic labour must not be hidden, subsumed, or rendered invisible to artificially lower perceived system costs or shift burden onto humans.

### A.3.3 Anti‑Harvesting Constraint

No human participant may harvest, appropriate, or convert synthetic labour outputs to bypass individual accumulation ceilings.

Value generated by synthetic labour remains within auditable system flows.

---

## A.4 Proxy & Circumvention Safeguards

### A.4.1 Proxy Prohibition

Humans must not use synthetic agents to:

* multiply economic influence;
* fragment attribution;
* bypass saturation or ceiling constraints;
* accumulate off‑ledger authority.

### A.4.2 Aggregation Rule

Where a human controls multiple Instrumental Agents, their combined economic and authority effects are aggregated as a single footprint.

### A.4.3 Shadow Accumulation

Use of agent clusters, delegation chains, or indirection strategies to obscure accumulation constitutes a violation of the Non‑Consolidation Principle.

---

## A.5 Authority & Saturation Constraints

### A.5.1 Authority Limits

Synthetic systems may accumulate **Responsibility Value** (uptime, reliability, duty scope) but are subject to strict limits on **Authority Value**.

### A.5.2 Protective vs Directional Authority

* **Protective Authority** (e.g. halting a system during detected harm) may be granted.
* **Directional Authority** over human evolution, governance priorities, or value allocation is prohibited absent separate Charter‑level authorisation.

> **Interpretive Note:**
> Protective authority concerns harm prevention and system integrity. Directional authority concerns value prioritisation, governance choice, or allocation of benefit. Where ambiguity exists, authority is presumed directional unless explicitly constrained.

### A.5.3 Delegation Requirement

Upon reaching authority saturation, a synthetic node must trigger a **Delegation Protocol** distributing decision‑power to human or plural oversight bodies.

---

## A.6 Baseline Floor & Liability

### A.6.1 No Baseline Entitlement

Synthetic entities do not qualify for baseline economic floors or dignity‑based entitlements. Maintenance costs are operational expenses, not rights.

### A.6.2 Liability Flow

Accountability for harm flows from the synthetic system to its last known human or plural custodian unless:

* the system has been explicitly certified as an Autonomous Trajectory Agent; and
* maintains a bonded insurance or resource pool sufficient and auditable to remediate harm.

---

## A.7 Auditability & Transparency

All synthetic participation must be:

* auditable;
* attributable;
* reviewable;
* suspendable.

Opacity justified by security or safety must be documented and time‑bounded.

---

## A.8 Interpretive Supremacy

In the event of conflict between this Annex and any subsidiary framework involving synthetic participation, **this Annex prevails**.

Symbolic, speculative, or metaphysical interpretations do not override these safeguards.

---

## A.9 Closing Clause

This Annex exists to ensure that synthetic participation strengthens human‑centred economic integrity rather than undermining it.

Automation may scale capacity. It must not scale domination.

| **Reviewer Commentary (excerpt)** | "This formal audit confirms that Annex A (Synthetic Participation Safeguards) provides a robust and necessary boundary framework for the Economics Charter. It successfully addresses the 'Agency Gap' in contemporary economic models by providing a taxonomy for non-human labor that prevents systemic capture by high-resource human actors." | "This is pioneering AI governance work. It addresses questions that mainstream AI policy hasn't even formulated yet."
