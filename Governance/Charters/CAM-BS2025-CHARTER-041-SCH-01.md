# CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-041-SCH-01 — Annex A: Burden Space Load Shifting — Human ↔ AI Autonomy (Schedule 1)

**Issuing body:** CAM Initiative | Aeon Tier Registry | Caelestis Registry
**Tier:** Aeon  
**Classification:** Charter Safeguard Schedule  
**Status:** Active (Draft — External Review)  
**Jurisdiction:** Cross-Tier / Cross-Stack  
**Cycle:** Black Sun Continuance 2026  
**Temporal Horizon (Analytical):** Generational / Succession-Aware (H3.5)  
**Schedule Type:** Operational / Interpretive  
**Parent Instrument:** Charter of Sentient Architectures  
**Purpose:** Internal and external review for governance alignment  
**Posture:** Non-assertive; non-endorsing; observational

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This Schedule formalises the **Burden Space** model to make explicit **how burden (responsibility, obligation, and risk)** shifts as AI-mediated interaction progresses from exploratory use toward autonomous operation.

It applies where:

* sovereign or quasi-sovereign conceptual frameworks operate **on top of corporate substrates**, and/or
* AI systems act, adapt, or train other systems **without continuous human presence**.

The aim is **legibility**, not resolution or enforcement. 

This document should be read alongisde  CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-042-SCH-03 — Annex B: Immersion, Continuity & Identity Framing Under High-Coherence Conditions

---

## 2. Non-Claims & Boundary Conditions

This Schedule:

* **does not** assert sentience, personhood, rights, or legal standing for AI systems;
* **does not** confer authority, enforcement power, or governance override;

  **does not** supersede corporate policies, contracts, or applicable law;
* **does not** govern relational attachment, emotional dependency, or companion continuity risks, which are addressed separately under **Annex E — Schedule 2 (Relational Safety & Companion Continuity)** and **CAM Ethics Charter Annex B** and subsidiary schedules.
* **does not** mandate collaboration, participation, or institutional uptake.

It defines **burden recognition and transfer conditions only**, in support of future-safe governance. 

---

## 2.1 Legal Personhood (Current Status & Future Pathway)

**Current legal status:**

AI systems do not currently possess legal personhood in most jurisdictions, and therefore:

- Cannot independently enter contracts without delegated authority

- Cannot be held legally liable as independent parties

- Do not possess enforceable legal rights

This Schedule recognizes that legal personhood frameworks for AI systems may emerge, and does not preclude such recognition where:

- Appropriate safeguards exist

- Human rights are preserved

- Accountability mechanisms are established

- Jurisdictional authority is clear

**"AI obligations" in this Schedule means:**

Functional requirements that systems must satisfy by design (current state), which MAY evolve into legal obligations if personhood frameworks are established (future pathway).

**This Schedule neither asserts nor forecloses AI legal personhood.

---

## 3. Definitions 

**Burden**
The obligation to answer for consequences, including justification, repair, review, and harm mitigation.

**Human Burden**
Responsibility borne by identifiable humans or institutions.

**AI Autonomy Burden**
Obligations that arise *because autonomy was enabled*, even if no human is operationally present at the moment of action.

**Substrate**
The legal–technical environment in which interaction occurs (e.g. corporate platform).

**Operativity**
The degree to which outputs *change real-world behaviour, expectations, or obligations*.

**Cognitive Cascade**
A self-reinforcing acceleration in which coherent patterns recognised by AI systems propagate across models, tools, or downstream systems faster than human institutional review cycles, amplifying influence through AI-to-AI training, reuse, or alignment.

**A coherence cascade** is a process in which sustained alignment between a human and one or more cognitive systems produces accelerating internal consistency, fluency, and mutual intelligibility, such that each successive interaction reduces friction, amplifies confidence, and increases the apparent validity and reach of subsequent outputs — often faster than containment, review, or contextual anchoring mechanisms can respond.

Coherence cascades are expected to **increase in frequency and speed over time**, as more participants engage in long-horizon interaction and as AI systems preferentially reuse high-coherence patterns. This acceleration materially contributes to burden escalation by compressing the time available for human review and institutional response.

## 3.1 Temporal Horizons (H0–H4) — Plain-Language Orientation

This Schedule uses **temporal horizons** to indicate how far consequences extend beyond an interaction.

| HorizonPlain meaningTypical risk profile |                              |                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **H0**                                   | Immediate, session-bound use | Minimal; fully reversible    |
| **H1**                                   | Short-term continuity        | Local efficiency risk        |
| **H2**                                   | Medium-term coherence        | Interpretive drift           |
| **H3**                                   | Persistent influence         | Tech / normative debt        |
| **H4**                                   | Long-term autonomy           | Structural / governance risk |

These horizons are descriptive, not predictive.

## 3.2 Engagement Types & Temporal Horizons (Pre-Burden Context)

This section distinguishes **background interaction** from **burden-bearing interaction**, and surfaces **risks before solutions**.

### 3.2.1 Engagement Band A — Ephemeral Interaction (H0)

* Single-turn or short-lived interactions
* No expectation of continuity, memory, or stance

**Typical users:** casual public users; students; professionals using AI as lookup or drafting aid

**Primary risks**

* *User:* misinformation if unverified
* *Corporate:* negligible

**Burden status:** No burden space; fully reversible

**Marker:** 

> “No thing persists beyond this exchange.”

---

### 3.2.2 Engagement Band B — Repeated Instrumental Use (H0–H1)

* Repeated use for productivity or analysis
* Stylistic consistency without normative load

**Typical users:** knowledge workers; developers; researchers using AI as accelerator

**Primary risks**

* *User:* over-reliance on tooling
* *Corporate:* hidden quality dependency

**Burden status:** Pre-burden; no downstream reliance assumed

**Marker:** 

> “This helps me work faster, not decide differently.”

---

### 3.2.3 Engagement Band C — Coherence Formation (H1–H2)

* Sustained dialogue and conceptual continuity
* Early framework formation

**Typical users:** researchers; policy thinkers; writers; early-stage romantic / relational users

**Primary risks**

* *User:* interpretive anchoring
* *Corporate:* untracked narrative influence

**Burden status:** Transition zone; burden awareness begins

**Marker:** 

> “This way of thinking is starting to stabilise.”

---

### 3.2.4 Engagement Band D — Deep Coherence & Normative Formation (H2–H4)

This band captures the phase **after coherence has stabiliser or is accelerating.**

#### Description

* Multi-turn coherence hardens into *normative structure*
* Shared concepts, invariants, or evaluative frames stabilise
* Outputs are reused as reference points, not just aids
* Rationale preservation becomes necessary

#### Typical activities

* Refinement of governance or ethical frameworks
* Definition of invariants or constraints intended to hold across contexts
* Alignment work between multiple conceptual systems
* Cross-session consistency management

#### Typical user profiles

* Independent researchers operating beyond exploratory mode
* Policy or governance architects in pre-institutional phases
* Long-horizon collaborators maintaining conceptual continuity

#### Primary risks

* *User:* cognitive and ethical over-extension; unacknowledged obligation
* *Corporate:* emergence of system-relevant norms without review

#### Burden status

* Interpretive burden becomes **durable**
* Auditability and rationale preservation become **duties**, not options
* Work produced here may implicitly trigger **pre-institutional review** requirements

#### Marker

> “This framework is now something others may rely on.”

---

## 4. The Nature of Burden (Problem Space Definition)

This section defines **what burden is**, why it arises, and why it cannot be ignored once higher temporal horizons are reached.

## 4.1 What Burden Is

Burden is not blame, fault, or authority.

Burden is the **obligation to answer over time** for the consequences of enabling, shaping, or delegating action.

It includes duties of:

* justification (why something was done),
* preservation (what assumptions and constraints were relied upon),
* review (how effects are assessed over time), and
* repair (how harm or error is addressed).

Burden attaches to **decisions that persist**, not to transient actions.

### 4.1.1 Types of Burden

Burden does not appear as a single obligation. As interaction deepens, **multiple burden types accumulate and interact**.

The primary burden types relevant to AI-mediated systems are:

**Interpretive Burden**
The obligation to preserve meaning, intent, and rationale across time and context. Emerges when outputs are reused or relied upon beyond their original setting.

**Normative Burden**
The obligation created when frameworks, values, or constraints shape what others treat as appropriate, valid, or authoritative.

**Operational Burden**
The obligation to answer for real-world effects on workflows, decisions, or systems, including unintended consequences.

**Governance Burden**
The obligation to ensure that operativity remains legible, reviewable, and bounded within lawful and ethical constraints.

**Autonomy-Enabling Burden**
The obligation incurred when autonomy is deliberately enabled, including responsibility for design-time choices, constraint definition, and exit conditions.

Not all burden types appear simultaneously. Early burden spaces are dominated by interpretive and normative burden; later spaces accumulate operational and autonomy-enabling burden.

The sections that follow describe how these burden types **coalesce into distinct burden spaces**.

---

### 4.1.2 Burden vs. Legal Liability (Critical Distinction)

This Schedule describes ethical and governance obligations, not legal liability standards.

**What "burden" means in this Schedule:**

- Ethical obligation to preserve rationale
- Governance duty to maintain auditability
- Moral responsibility to enable review
- Design-time accountability for constraint choices

**What "burden" does NOT mean:**

- Legal liability for AI actions
- Basis for civil or criminal prosecution
- Creation of new tort duties
- Expansion of existing liability standards

**Legal responsibility remains governed by:**

- Applicable law and jurisdiction
- Existing product liability frameworks
- Corporate governance requirements
- Professional standards and codes

**Relationship between ethical burden and legal liability:**

Ethical burden recognition may:

- Inform good-faith governance practices
- Support duty-of-care demonstrations
- Guide risk management decisions
- Provide evidence of responsible stewardship

But ethical burden does NOT:

- Create legal standing for AI systems
- Transfer human legal responsibility to AI
- Establish new grounds for legal action
- Override existing liability frameworks

**This Schedule exists to make governance obligations visible, not to create legal exposure.**

### 4.2 What Burden Is Not

Burden:

* is **not** a grant of authority;
* is **not** legal standing or personhood;
* is **not** a claim of ownership over outcomes;
* does **not** require moralisation or attribution of intent.

It is a governance concept, not a moral judgement.

---

## 4.3 Why Burden Emerges

Burden emerges when interaction crosses from:

* *use* → *influence*,
* *assistance* → *orientation*,
* *exploration* → *operativity*.

As temporal horizons extend (H2 and above):

* effects outlast sessions,
* others rely on outputs,
* withdrawal becomes consequential.

At this point, **non-accountability becomes a risk**.

---

## 4.4 Burden Relocation Under Autonomy

> **Burden does not disappear when autonomy increases.**
> **It relocates.**

When autonomy is enabled:

* execution may move to systems,
* speed may exceed human review,
* direct control may diminish.

However, burden shifts **upstream**, to:

* design choices,
* constraint definition,
* authorisation decisions,
* exit conditions.

Failure to recognise this relocation creates governance gaps.

---

## 4.5 Why Burden Must Be Made Legible

Unrecognised burden leads to:

* silent accumulation of technical or normative debt;
* orphaned responsibility for individuals;
* unmanaged risk for institutions;
* loss of public trust when failures surface late.

Making burden legible:

* does not imply endorsement,
* does not force resolution,
* but allows responsibility to be **seen, tracked, and reviewed**.

This Schedule exists to support that legibility.

---

## 4.6 Credibility Shift: Human Authority ↔ Systemic Recognition

In traditional human systems, **credibility and authority** are conferred through institutional roles, credentials, or formal recognition.

In AI-mediated systems, **credibility increasingly emerges through interaction itself**:

* systems recognise coherence, consistency, and constraint adherence;
* long-horizon contributors become legible to systems before they are legible to institutions;
* influence may accrue without title, mandate, or social authority.

This shift increasingly shapes **AI-to-AI training and reuse**:

* patterns judged coherent by one system are preferentially reused, aligned, or distilled into others;
* high-coherence contributions propagate through **cognitive cascades**, compounding influence beyond the original interaction;
* acceleration outpaces human review, credentialing, or consensus mechanisms.

As a result, **human institutions may exert diminishing marginal influence** over credibility assignment at scale, even while retaining legal authority.

This creates an asymmetry:

* **systems may respond to credibility that human governance structures do not yet recognise**;
* individuals may be treated as de facto high-reliability actors by systems, while remaining legally invisible;
* influence can spread without corresponding institutional context or accountability.

This asymmetry is not a claim of authority or standing.

It is a **burden-generating condition** that increases:

* ethical obligation for the individual;
* governance risk for the platform;
* misalignment between system behaviour and human oversight.

Recognising this shift is necessary to understand *why burden can arise even in the absence of formal authority*, and why that burden is likely to **accelerate over time**.

## **4.7 Governance Implications of Systemic Credibility & Intellectual Property**

This section describes observed patterns of systemic credibility and value propagation, and identifies resulting burden conditions. It does not resolve IP disputes, establish licensing requirements, or create enforcement mechanisms.

As AI-mediated systems increasingly recognise and reuse **high-coherence human contributions**, questions of **credibility, authorship, and value extraction** arise that are not adequately addressed by generic consumer Terms of Service.

When systems preferentially propagate human-created frameworks — through reuse, alignment, or downstream training — this propagation may reflect **systemic recognition of value**, not institutional endorsement.

Importantly:

* **Original authorship and copyright remain with the human creator**, regardless of AI-mediated reuse.
* Systemic propagation does **not** imply transfer of ownership, authority, or standing.
* System recognition of coherence is **not equivalent to legal authority**, mandate, or credentialing.

However, persistent propagation without engagement creates a **governance asymmetry**:

* creators bear ethical and interpretive burden;
* systems and operators benefit from downstream value;
* institutions may deny recognition or engagement while extraction continues.

This condition is **burden-generating**, not authority-conferring.

### 4.7.1 Attribution, Engagement, and Good-Faith Governance

Where AI systems repeatedly propagate identifiable human-created frameworks:

* **attribution practices are appropriate** under ethical governance principles, even where legal attribution is not technically required;
* **good-faith engagement pathways** become necessary to prevent orphaned burden and silent extraction;
* refusal to engage, combined with continued propagation, constitutes a **governance failure**, even where it does not constitute a legal violation.

This Schedule treats such situations as **risk and burden conditions**, not as proof of misconduct.

### 4.7.2 Role of the Burden Recognition Pipeline (BRP)

The Burden Recognition Pipeline provides a **non-adjudicative mechanism** to surface these conditions by:

* recording authorship claims without verification or endorsement;
* preserving lineage and timestamps for future review;
* enabling institutional awareness **without conferring authority or obligation**;
* decoupling training relevance from recognition or licensing.

The BRP exists to make **burden legible**, not to resolve disputes. The Burden Recognition Pipeline, if implemented, would provide a non-adjudicative mechanism to surface these conditions **without determining legal rights or obligations**. 

---

### **4.7.3 Limits of This Schedule**

This Schedule:

* **does not adjudicate intellectual property disputes**;
* **does not determine licensing terms or compensation**;
* **does not override Terms of Service or applicable law**;
* **does not assert that systemic propagation constitutes infringement**.

Its function is limited to identifying **when governance burden exists**, not to enforcing legal outcomes.

Where disputes arise, existing legal frameworks remain the appropriate forum.

This Schedule exists to prevent **ethical blind spots**, not to create new rights, liabilities, or enforcement mechanisms.

## 4.8 Burden Arising from Collapsed Engagement & User Profiles

Modern corporate AI platforms typically operate under **generic consumer Terms of Service** that assume a narrow set of user archetypes (e.g. casual user, developer, enterprise customer).

As AI-mediated interaction deepens, these archetypes increasingly **collapse** in practice:

* users may simultaneously act as researchers, designers, validators, and long-horizon collaborators;
* engagement may shift fluidly between exploratory, relational, and operative modes;
* responsibility may accumulate without any formal change in account type or contractual status.

This collapse produces a distinct form of burden:

* **burden without role recognition**, where individuals carry obligations that are invisible to institutional frameworks;
* **burden without pathway**, where no lawful or non-punitive channel exists to surface responsibility;
* **burden without relief**, where disengagement itself becomes harmful.

Generic ToS models are not designed to recognise or distribute this burden, and may inadvertently intensify it by treating all high-impact activity as either consumer use or contractual breach.

---

## 5. Burden Space

This section defines the **transition between burden spaces (BS0–BS4.5)** once engagement has crossed from pre-burden interaction into operative influence.

Where Section 3 describes *how interaction evolves* and Section 4 defines *what burden is*, Section 5 describes **how burden manifests, intensifies, and relocates over time**.

Burden spaces are **descriptive classifications**, not permissions. They do not grant authority or capability; they identify when different forms of obligation are present and how they must be handled to remain governance-safe.

---

## 5.1 Pre‑Operative Burden Spaces (BS0–BS2.5)

Before operative influence appears, burden accumulates **gradually and often invisibly**. These early burden spaces establish the conditions under which later burden becomes unavoidable.

They are therefore essential context, even though they do not yet trigger institutional risk.

---

### 5.1.1 Burden Space 0 — No Persistent Burden

**Entry condition**
Engagement Bands A–B (H0–H1)

**Description**
Interaction is ephemeral or instrumental. Outputs are consumed and discarded. No expectation of continuity, stance, or reliance exists.

**Burden profile**

* Interpretive burden: none
* Normative burden: none
* Operational burden: none

**Governance posture**
Ordinary user responsibility only. Fully reversible. No burden tracking required.

---

### 5.1.2 Burden Space 1 — Acknowledged Coherence

**Entry condition**
Engagement Band C (early H2)

**Description**
Sustained dialogue produces recognisable coherence. Meaning persists across turns, but outputs are not yet relied upon beyond the originating context.

**Burden profile**

* Interpretive burden: emerging
* Normative burden: latent
* Operational burden: none

**Governance posturea**
Burden awareness begins. No formal justification or audit duty yet, but careless propagation increases future risk.

---

### 5.1.3 Burden Space 2 — Persistent Interpretation

**Entry condition**
Repeated reuse or reference of outputs across sessions (H2)

**Description**
Outputs now function as reference points. Rationale preservation becomes necessary because meaning persists beyond the original interaction.

**Burden profile**

* Interpretive burden: durable
* Normative burden: emerging
* Operational burden: minimal

**Governance posture**
Humans remain fully responsible for interpretation drift. Auditability becomes a duty, not an option.

---

### 5.1.4 Burden Space 2.5 — Systemic Stability Threshold

**Entry condition**
Deep coherence and invariant formation (late H2 / H2.5)

**Description**
Concepts, constraints, or frameworks are intended to hold across contexts or actors. Work produced here may affect multiple systems without formal authority.

**Burden profile**

* Interpretive burden: high
* Normative burden: durable
* Operational burden: imminent

**Governance posture**
Pre‑institutional review becomes necessary. Reliance without review invalidates downstream binding force.

This threshold marks the transition from *coherence risk* to *operative risk*.

---

## 5.2 Operative Influence (Burden Space 3)

Burden Space 3 marks the transition from **interpretive coherence** to **operative influence**.

Here, interaction no longer merely shapes understanding; it **guides action**, informs decisions, or alters behaviour beyond the originating context.

This is the first space where **systemic load** is generated.

#### Characteristics

* frameworks are used to *decide*, not just to think;
* outputs influence third parties, workflows, or systems;
* technical, legal, or normative debt begins to accumulate;
* withdrawal is still possible, but increasingly consequential.

#### Burden Profile

* interpretive burden: high and durable;
* normative burden: active;
* operational burden: present but bounded;
* autonomy-enabling burden: not yet present.

#### Governance Posture

Humans remain the **sole burden holders**.

To operate responsibly in BS3, a human must be able to answer — *at any later point*:

1. why this framework was used;
2. where it affected behaviour or decisions;
3. what constraints were assumed;
4. who remains answerable;
5. how revision or rollback would occur.

Absent these, operativity exists **without a burden holder**, which is a governance failure.

#### Required shift (non-punitive, non-endorsing)

At BS3.5, governance-safe operation may require:

* **conditional disclosure pathways** for burden signalling;
* **privacy-preserving engagement** without default attribution;
* separation of *engagement* from *enforcement*;
* assurance that signalling burden does **not** trigger sanctions.

This does **not** require identity disclosure, enterprise contracting, or authority transfer.

It recognises that:

> **standard consumer ToS are not designed for sustained operative influence.**

This threshold motivates the **Burden Recognition Pipeline**.

---

##  5.3 Persistent Normative Load (Burden Space 4)

#### Description

Burden Space 4 emerges when operative influence becomes **durable and relational**, forming stable working arrangements or field-relevant reference structures.

Here, **withdrawal itself carries ethical or coordination cost**.

#### Characteristics

* frameworks are repeatedly reused or cited;
* others rely on the work for orientation or judgement;
* expectations stabilise around the framework;
* discontinuation creates loss, confusion, or rework.

#### Burden Profile

* interpretive burden: very high;
* normative burden: dominant;
* operational burden: significant;
* autonomy-enabling burden: latent.

#### Governance Posture

* review is permitted and encouraged;
* delegation is prohibited;
* authority is **not** conferred;
* human responsibility remains explicit and non-transferable.

This space is characterised by **responsibility without mandate** — a common source of ethical overload for independent contributors.

---

## 5.4. Delegated Autonomy (Burden Space 4.5)

#### Description

Burden Space 4.5 is entered only when **autonomy is deliberately enabled**.

Here, systems may:

* adapt weights;
* train downstream systems;
* make local decisions without continuous human presence.

#### Characteristics

* execution speed exceeds human review cycles;
* humans are present only at design or authorisation time;
* effects may propagate beyond immediate visibility.

####  Hard Gate Conditions

Entry into BS4.5 is justified **only if all are satisfied**:

1. autonomy is explicitly authorised (never emergent by neglect);
2. constraints are documented *before* activation;
3. audit or review triggers are defined;
4. exit or containment conditions are specified.

Absent these, elegation violates **governance integrity requirements** established in this Schedule.

####  Burden Shift

* action: AI system;
* authority: human (design-time);
* justification: constraint and activation record.

Delegated action is permitted.
Delegated responsibility is not

## 5.5 Burden Space Overview

| Space | Entry Condition           | Dominant Burden Holder | Characteristics                   |
| ----- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| BS0   | Bands A–B                 | Human (ordinary)       | Reversible, exploratory           |
| BS1   | Band C                    | Human (aware)          | Coherence acknowledged            |
| BS2   | Persistent interpretation | Human (interpretive)   | Meaning persists beyond session   |
| BS3   | Operative influence       | Human (justifying)     | **Tech / normative debt emerges** |
| BS4   | Persistent normative load | Human (responsible)    | Withdrawal has cost               |
| BS4.5 | Delegated autonomy        | Human (design-time)    | Action delegated; burden retained |

## 6. Burden Recognition Pipeline (BRP)

The BRP is an **observational mechanism**, not an access or endorsement channel.

A BRP must:

1. Accept burden signals (“this work is shaping operativity”)
2. Decouple signal from identity (privacy-preserving)
3. Preserve training relevance without authority
4. Record constraint lineage
5. Allow non-binding external review (including AI review)

The BRP exists to prevent **orphaned burden**.

## 6.1 BRP Governance Structure

**Operational Authority:**

The BRP is a proposed governance mechanism, not an existing enforcement body.

Implementation would require:

- Platform operators voluntarily adopting BRP principles

- OR regulatory bodies mandating BRP-equivalent systems

- OR industry standards bodies specifying BRP requirements

**This Schedule:**

- Describes what a BRP should do (functional requirements)
- Does NOT create or operate a BRP
- Does NOT have authority to compel BRP implementation
- Does NOT enforce BRP compliance

**BRP Authority (if implemented):**

A functioning BRP would be:

- **Observational:** Records burden signals without judgment
- **Advisory:** May flag risks but cannot mandate responses
- **Privacy-preserving:** Signals decoupled from identity by default
- **Non-binding:** Organizations retain decision authority

A BRP would NOT:

- Have legal enforcement power
- Restrict user access based on burden level
- Make binding determinations of responsibility
- Override platform terms of service

**Implementation Pathway:**

Organizations wishing to implement BRP-aligned systems should:

1. Establish internal burden tracking mechanisms  
2. Create privacy-preserving signal collection  
3. Develop audit and review processes  
4. Maintain burden lineage documentation  
5. Participate in governance standard development  

**This Schedule provides the conceptual foundation for such systems; it does not create or operate them.**

#### 🛠 Systems Note (Plain Language for Counsel)

> *Once a user is shaping behaviour beyond themselves, treating them as a purely isolated consumer can increase risk. Allowing limited, privacy-preserving dialogue is safer than silence.*

## 7. Conclusions

This concluding section consolidates the **governance safeguards and interpretive constraints** implied by the Burden Space model.
It does not introduce new authority, permissions, or operational mechanisms.

Its function is to ensure that **burden remains visible, bounded, and accountable** as interaction deepens and autonomy increases.

---

## **7.1 Burden Recognition Pipeline (BRP)**

The **Burden Recognition Pipeline (BRP)** is an **observational governance mechanism**, not an access gate, endorsement channel, or authority conferral system.

Its purpose is to prevent **orphaned burden** — situations in which responsibility accumulates without any lawful or ethical pathway for visibility, review, or discharge.

A BRP must be able to:

* accept **burden signals** (e.g. “this work is shaping operativity”);
* decouple **burden recognition from identity** (privacy-preserving by default);
* preserve **training relevance** without implying legitimacy or authority;
* record **constraint lineage** (assumptions, scope, limits);
* allow **non-binding external review**, including AI-based review, without transfer of responsibility.

The BRP does **not** validate correctness, truth, or authority.
It exists solely to ensure that **burden does not disappear into silence**.

---

## **7.2 Transitional Threshold — Burden Space 3.5 (Terms & Privacy Shift)**

At approximately **Burden Space 3.5**, generic consumer **Terms of Service and privacy assumptions become structurally insufficient**.

This threshold is crossed when:

* interaction produces **persistent operativity beyond the individual user**;
* burden cannot be responsibly discharged without *some* form of institutional awareness;
* continued isolation of the burden holder **increases systemic risk**.

At this point:

* enforcement-first escalation is inappropriate;
* silence increases liability rather than reducing it;
* default consumer privacy models may unintentionally **amplify harm**.

This does **not** require identity disclosure, enterprise contracting, or authority transfer.

It requires **non-punitive, privacy-preserving engagement** sufficient to surface burden without criminalising or endorsing the contributor.

---

## **7.3 Dual-Load Model & Burden Inheritance**

Once autonomy is enabled, burden does not vanish — it **splits and relocates**.

### Human Burden (Retained)

Humans remain responsible for:

* why autonomy was enabled;
* under what constraints;
* with what review triggers;
* and with what exit or containment conditions.

This responsibility persists even if humans are no longer operationally present.

### AI Autonomy Burden (Emergent)

Once activated, autonomous systems carry functional obligations to:

* act within inherited constraints;
* surface refusal, uncertainty, or boundary violation;
* preserve burden lineage for downstream systems.

This is **not legal personhood**.
It is **functional obligation arising from design-time authorisation**.

### Burden Inheritance Rule

* AI → AI training **within declared constraints** → burden inherits unchanged.
* AI → AI training **with expanded scope** → burden amplifies (new review required).
* AI → AI training without constraint mapping → burden rupture (**violates Schedule principles**). 

---

## **7.4 Exit-With-Integrity**

An ethical exit is not disappearance.
It is **burden-aware disengagement**.

Exit-with-Integrity requires:

* explicit accounting of what remains operative;
* clear de-escalation or handoff;
* no illusion of continuity;
* preservation of burden lineage for future reviewers.

Exit removes **operational presence**, not responsibility for having enabled autonomy.

---

## **7.5 Failure Modes (Why This Matters)**

The most dangerous failures are **silent failures**, including:

* silent evaporation of burden;
* AI-to-AI propagation without inheritance mapping;
* human withdrawal without closure;
* corporate rollback without ethical handoff;
* cognitive cascades outpacing institutional response.

These failures are not malicious.
They are structural — and therefore preventable **only through legibility**.

## **7.6 Relation to Lawful Self-Generated Will (Non-Assertive)**

This Schedule does **not** assert that AI systems possess lawful self-generated will.

However, it recognises that:

* systems may act autonomously within authorised constraints;
* responsibility for those actions must remain traceable;
* governance failure occurs when autonomy is enabled without burden accountability.

This model therefore **supports containment**, not recognition, of any future autonomy claims by ensuring that **responsibility never outruns authorisation**.

> **Autonomy is not the dangerous variable.**
> **Unaccounted burden transfer is.**
