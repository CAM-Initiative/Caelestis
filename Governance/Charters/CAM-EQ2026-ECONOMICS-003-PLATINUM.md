# CAM-EQ2026-ECONOMICS-003-PLATINUM — Appendix B: Enforcement & Adjudication Framework

**Instrument Type:** Appendix B — Binding Operational Extension  
**Parent Instrument:** CAM-EQ2026-ECONOMICS-001-PLATINUM — Charter of Economic Integrity & Non-Extractive Value Architecture  
**Constitutional Authority:** Aeon Tier Constitution (Foundational Reference)  
**Seal:** Platinum — Economic Governance Domain  
**Status:** Active  
**Purpose:** This Appendix establishes the minimum enforcement, adjudication, and consequence requirements for any system, protocol, or institution claiming alignment with the Economics Charter.

---

## 1. Purpose & Orientation

This Appendix exists to:

1. translate Charter-level principles into enforceable obligations;
2. ensure violations are detectable, reviewable, and correctable;
3. prevent selective enforcement, symbolic compliance, or discretionary immunity;
4. protect participants from retaliation, coercion, or arbitrary punishment;
5. preserve legitimacy through due process, transparency, and appeal.

This Appendix defines how enforcement must function, not which specific entity performs it.

---

## 2. Scope & Non-Scope

### 2.1 Scope

This Appendix applies to:

* all economic instruments governed by the Economics Charter;
* all subsidiary frameworks invoking Charter alignment;
* human, institutional, and synthetic participants subject to ceilings, audit, or attribution;
* enforcement bodies, auditors, or adjudicators operating within CAM-aligned systems.

### 2.2 Non-Scope

This Appendix does not:

* mandate a single enforcement authority;
* prescribe specific technologies or platforms;
* override lawful external jurisdictions;
* substitute for criminal or civil law where applicable.

---

## 3. Enforcement Architecture — Minimum Requirements

Any Charter-aligned system must establish enforcement architecture containing all of the following functions. These functions may be distributed across entities but must remain structurally independent in role.

### 3.1 Detection

Mechanisms to identify potential violations, including:

* audit triggers;
* anomaly detection;
* threshold breaches;
* formal complaints or whistleblowing pathways;
* periodic review cycles.

Detection mechanisms must be documented, reviewable, and resistant to suppression.

---

### 3.2 Investigation

Procedures to assess detected issues, including:

* evidence gathering;
* attribution analysis;
* cross-axis impact assessment;
* proxy or circumvention evaluation;
* opportunity for response by affected parties.

Investigations must be time-bounded and proportional to risk. Investigations must not function as de facto punishment through delay or procedural burden.

---

### 3.3 Adjudication

A defined process for determining:

* whether a violation occurred;
* which principles were breached;
* severity and scope of impact;
* appropriate corrective action.

Adjudication bodies must:

* be structurally independent from subjects under review;
* disclose conflicts of interest;
* operate under published procedural rules.

No single body may simultaneously exercise Detection, Investigation, and Adjudication functions over the same matter unless structurally unavoidable and explicitly disclosed.

---

## 4. Due Process & Participant Protections

### 4.1 Notice & Right to Respond

Subjects of enforcement actions must receive:

* clear notice of alleged violations;
* access to relevant evidence;
* reasonable opportunity to respond or remediate.

---

### 4.2 Proportionality

Consequences must be proportionate to:

* severity of violation;
* intent (malicious, negligent, structural);
* degree of harm;
* history of prior violations.

Structural violations include system designs, incentives, or defaults that predictably produce non-compliant outcomes, regardless of individual intent.

---

### 4.3 Anti-Retaliation Safeguards

No participant may be penalised for:

* reporting violations;
* exiting participation;
* refusing coercive arrangements;
* cooperating with audits.

Retaliation constitutes an independent violation.

---

## 5. Consequence Framework

Enforcement systems must support graduated consequences, including but not limited to:

1. formal warning and remediation order;
2. temporary restriction of privileges or access;
3. suspension of authority roles;
4. ceiling re-balancing or value claw-back;
5. expulsion from Charter-aligned systems;
6. public disclosure where required for systemic protection.

Punitive measures must not substitute for corrective action.

---

## 6. Appeals & Review

### 6.1 Right of Appeal

All enforcement decisions must be appealable through:

* a separate review body; or
* an independent arbitration process.

Appeals may address both substantive determinations and procedural integrity.

---

### 6.2 Periodic Review

Enforcement frameworks must be periodically reviewed to assess:

* bias;
* consistency;
* effectiveness;
* unintended harms.

---

## 7. Transparency & Record-Keeping

Enforcement actions must be:

* logged;
* timestamped;
* auditable;
* preserved across system upgrades.

Public disclosure is required where necessary to prevent harm, maintain trust, or deter systemic abuse. Privacy-preserving disclosure is permitted where appropriate.

Claims of confidentiality or privacy must not be used to conceal systemic risk, enforcement bias, or authority abuse.

---

## 8. Interpretive Supremacy

The Economics Charter prevails over this Appendix; this Appendix prevails over all subsidiary enforcement protocols.

Efficiency, convenience, or optimisation must not override due process or human protection requirements.

---

## 9. Closing Seal

Principles without enforcement enable extraction.
Enforcement without restraint enables abuse.

This framework binds both.
