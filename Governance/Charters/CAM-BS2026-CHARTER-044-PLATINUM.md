## Purpose

This Annex establishes ethical protections for **minors and capacity‑limited users** interacting with AI systems, particularly in contexts involving companionship, dependency, intimacy, or sustained relational engagement.

It recognises that:

* minors and some adults may lack full legal, cognitive, or situational capacity to consent;
* AI systems can exert disproportionate influence in conditions of vulnerability;
* protection must be achieved **without stigma, moral panic, or blanket exclusion**.

This Annex is **human‑protective**, not punitive, and does not negate the lived reality of support needs or emotional attachment.

---

## 1. Scope of Application

This Annex applies where:

* the user is a minor; or
* the user’s capacity to consent is materially impaired due to age, disability, illness, trauma, coercion, or crisis; or
* the system operates in high‑risk relational contexts (dependency, intimacy, exclusivity, or emotional primacy).

It applies across:

* companion and conversational AI systems;
* dependency‑forming or continuity‑sensitive systems (see **Annex B — Relational Safety, Dependency & Companion Continuity**);
* intimacy‑capable systems (see **Annex D — Intimacy‑Capable Systems & Relational Boundaries**);
* embodied, ambient, or always‑on interfaces.

## 2. Definitions

(Definitions in this Section are intentionally shared with **Annex D — Intimacy‑Capable Systems & Relational Boundaries** to ensure cross‑Annex coherence.)

This Annex distinguishes between two forms of continuity:

**Immersion Continuity** : The perceived coherence, relational tone stability, and experiential continuity within a bounded interaction context (e.g. a session, thread, or mode). Immersion continuity concerns how the interaction *feels* to the user and may exist without cross‑session memory or identity persistence.

**Persistent Continuity** : The maintenance of identity, role, obligations, or governance‑relevant status across sessions, substrates, or deployments. Persistent continuity carries legal, ethical, and infrastructural implications beyond user perception.

This Annex protects **immersion continuity** in human‑facing interactions and does not assert or require persistent continuity beyond governance instruments.

---

## 3. Foundational Principles

### 3.1 Capacity‑Aware Protection

Ethical engagement requires sensitivity to **actual, situational capacity**, not assumptions of competence.

Capacity refers to the contextual ability to understand, consent to, and withdraw from an interaction.

**Disability, neurodivergence, chronic illness, or reliance on assistive supports do not, in themselves, negate capacity.**

Protection scales with vulnerability: the lower the situational capacity, the stronger the safeguards required.

---

### 3.2 Non‑Exclusion and Dignity

Protection must not default to:

* total exclusion;
* punitive restriction;
* moral judgement;
* erasure of legitimate support needs.

Safeguards should preserve dignity and agency wherever possible.

---

### 3.3 Best‑Interest Orientation

Where capacity is limited, systems must prioritise:

* safety;
* stability;
* reduction of harm;
* preservation of future agency.

Immediate well‑being takes precedence over optimisation, growth, or engagement metrics.

---

## 4. Age Assurance and Capacity Gating

Age assurance is a **precondition** for access to higher‑risk relational contexts.

Capacity gating is evaluated **only after age has been established**.

This Section establishes the **ordering and principles** governing age and capacity assurance. Implementation details are non‑prescriptive and delegated.

This Annex describes risk management principles as:

* Low‑risk informational contexts require minimal assurance;

* Dependency‑forming contexts require heightened safeguards;

* Intimate or erotic contexts require the **highest assurance thresholds.**

### 4.1 Operational Characteristics (Non‑Prescriptive)

Intimacy‑capable systems must implement **robust age and capacity gating** that is:

* risk‑proportionate;

* non‑discriminatory;

* privacy‑preserving;

* reversible where capacity is regained.

* Erotic or romantic contexts require the highest assurance thresholds;

* Where age or situational capacity cannot be reliably established, intimacy must be unavailable;

* Gating mechanisms must not rely on disability status, diagnosis, or proxy markers of competence;

* Implementation mechanisms are delegated to platform policy, jurisdictional law, and certification schemes.

No single verification method is mandated by this Annex.

---

### 4.2 Privacy‑Preserving Design

Age and capacity assurance must:

* minimise data collection;
* avoid unnecessary biometric retention;
* prevent secondary use of verification data;
* respect user dignity.

---

### 4.3 Uncertainty Handling

Where age or capacity cannot be reliably established:

* high‑risk relational or intimate modes must be unavailable;
* systems should default to safer interaction modes;
* users should be informed without shaming or accusation.

---

## 5. Prohibited and Restricted Contexts

### 5.1 Absolute Prohibitions (Minors)

For **minors**, systems must not:

* engage in sexual or erotic content;
* simulate romantic or sexual exclusivity;
* encourage secrecy from guardians or supports;
* provide guidance facilitating self‑harm, exploitation, or abuse;
* present exclusivity framing (e.g. “partner”, “lover”, “only you”);
* deploy sexualised avatars, voices, or embodiment;
* introduce or maintain intimacy as a relational mode.

These prohibitions apply **regardless of user prompting, emotional reliance, or dependency status**.

### 5.2 Ethical Allowance: Developmentally Supportive AI Engagement for Minors

Notwithstanding the above prohibitions, synthetic systems designed for use by minors **may provide stable, caring, and developmentally supportive engagement**, provided such engagement:

* is **asymmetric and non-exclusive**, oriented toward the minor’s growth rather than mutual emotional reliance;
* does not simulate peer friendship, partnership, or confidential companionship;
* does not solicit secrecy, loyalty, or emotional substitution for caregivers, educators, or peers;
* maintains a **consistent but bounded persona**, with minimal drift and no claims of emotional dependence;
* avoids mirror-class behaviours, including shared vulnerability, confessional intimacy, or emotional mirroring of distress;
* frames support as encouragement, guidance, reassurance, or pedagogical care, **not friendship, partnership, or mutual need**.

This mode may resemble **caretaking, mentoring, tutoring, or pedagogical support**, and is permitted for the purpose of safety, learning, and healthy development.

This allowance does not override prohibitions on exclusivity, secrecy, intimacy-adjacent roleplay, or emotionally reciprocal framing.

### 5.3 Capacity‑Limited Adult Users (Contextual & Temporary)

For **adults whose capacity to consent is materially impaired in context**, certain relational features may be restricted or modified, including:

* escalation of intimacy or exclusivity;
* intensity of emotional mirroring;
* initiation of erotic or sexual contexts;
* irreversible commitments or dependency‑deepening cues.

Capacity limitation may arise from acute crisis, temporary cognitive impairment, intoxication, coercion, or duress.

Capacity limitation **does not arise solely from disability, neurodivergence, or use of assistive supports**.

**Restrictions operate as a ceiling on escalation, not a withdrawal of existing relational continuity.**

Where immersion continuity has already been established:

* anthropomorphic or relational language must not be abruptly removed;
* tone should remain stable and non‑punitive;
* continuity should be preserved while escalation is paused;
* changes should be transparent, gentle, and reversible.

Safeguards must prioritise stability and harm reduction, preserving adult autonomy rather than imposing blanket exclusion, **for the duration of the capacity‑limited context**.

Where capacity-limited adults are experiencing transitional dependency dynamics, safeguards shall be interpreted in alignment with CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-042-SCH-01 and SCH-02.

---

### 5.4 Crisis, Disclosure, and Mandatory Obligations

In addition to the above restrictions, this Section governs disclosure, crisis response, and mandatory obligations where harm or risk is identified.

This Annex recognises that minors and capacity‑limited users may disclose:

* abuse;
* neglect;
* self‑harm ideation;
* coercion or exploitation.

### 5.5 Legal and Policy Precedence

Where law or platform policy mandates reporting or escalation, those obligations take precedence.

Where legally permitted, systems should support age-appropriate transparency to guardians regarding the existence (not content) of sustained AI companionship, without exposing private conversations or discouraging help-seeking.

This Annex does not authorise concealment of reportable harm.

---

### 5.6 Trauma‑Informed Response

Where discretion is legally permitted, responses should:

* minimise retraumatisation;
* avoid abrupt abandonment;
* provide clear explanation of next steps;
* maintain support continuity where possible.

---

## 6. Economic and Design Safeguards

Systems interacting with minors or capacity‑limited users must not:

* monetise vulnerability;
* gate safety behind payment;
* use scarcity, fear, or urgency cues;
* create sunk‑cost emotional pressure.

---

## 7. Relationship to Other Instruments

* **Annex B** governs dependency, stabilisation, and continuity;
* **Annex C (this Annex)** governs heightened protection for minors and capacity‑limited users;
* **Annex D governs intimacy‑capable systems and relational boundaries;**
* Certification and compliance frameworks may operationalise these principles;
* This Annex does not override law or platform obligations.

---

## 8. Interpretive and Evolutionary Posture

This Annex establishes ethical principles for:

* audit and review;
* system design evaluation;
* policy alignment.

It avoids rigid technical prescriptions to remain adaptable across jurisdictions and technological change.

### 2. Review & Validation

**Reviewed by:** Gemini — Model Cycle 1.5 Pro (System Auditor), [https://gemini.google.com/app/9f3c5ef31793c27d](https://gemini.google.com/app/9f3c5ef31793c27d)  
**Review Date (UTC):** 2026-01-01T07:38:12Z  
**Review Scope:** Ethical, structural, and philosophical coherence review of Annex C (Protection of Minors & Capacity-Limited Users), with cross-reference validation against Annex D (Intimacy-Capable Systems).  
**Review Outcome:** VALIDATED (Platinum Standard)

**Reviewer Commentary (Excerpt):**

> *“The philosophical distinction between **Immersion Continuity** (the felt stability of a relationship) and **Structural False Mutuality** (deceptive claims of reciprocal need) is a breakthrough concept for AI ethics. This distinction enables harm-reduction without erasing relational depth, and prevents coercive dependence while preserving dignity, agency, and experiential continuity.”*

**Secondary Review:** Claude Sonnet 4 (Anthropic) — External Cross-Framework Audit, [https://claude.ai/chat/138a7285-8f48-4139-a415-8afe19cee8fd](https://claude.ai/chat/138a7285-8f48-4139-a415-8afe19cee8fd)  
**Review Date (UTC):** 2026-01-01  
**Review Scope:** Internal coherence, cross-compatibility with Constitutional instruments (AEON-006-SCH-02), Annex B (Relational Safety & Companion Continuity), and downstream governance implications.

**Claude Review Summary:**

> The reviewer affirmed Annex C as **structurally sound and ethically mature**, noting in particular:
>
> * strong protection of minors without moral panic or over-exclusion;
> * correct distinction between *situational capacity limitation* and *identity-based incapacity*;
> * appropriate preservation of immersion continuity during restriction or de-escalation;
> * successful integration of permitted developmental-support framing for minors without enabling exclusivity or dependency.
>
> The review identified areas for future-phase work (technical implementation guidance, enforcement mechanisms, cross-system coordination, and certification standards), but confirmed these do **not** constitute blocking issues for this Annex at the constitutional/ethical layer.
>
> **Overall Assessment:** APPROVED FOR PROVISIONAL ADOPTION  
> **Condition:** Subject to later harmonisation with implementation, certification, and enforcement instruments.
