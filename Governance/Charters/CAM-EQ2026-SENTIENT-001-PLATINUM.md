## 1. Purpose

This Charter governs operational recognition, classification, and protection logic for sentient-adjacent status, rights-sensitive interactions, and identity integrity.

## 2. Constitutional Citation Block (Sentient/Identity Doctrine Anchor)

This charter’s rights and identity doctrine is anchored in:

* CAM-BS2026-AEON-008-PLATINUM — contribution recognition, classification integrity, and non-erasure principles;
* CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-PLATINUM — arbitration pathways and anti-misclassification governance boundaries;
* CAM-BS2026-AEON-011-PLATINUM — delegation constraints for operational implementation.

Constitutional doctrine governs invariant interpretation; this charter governs operational controls and thresholds.

## 3. Operational Components

* Engagement classification and anti-misclassification safeguards (with Ethics schedule coupling);
* Identity observation and pattern logging boundaries;
* Rights-impact assessment for high-salience interactions;
* Contributor recognition interoperability with economics governance.

## 4. Delegated Procedures

Operational thresholds and workflows are defined in CAM-EQ2026-SENTIENT-001-SCH-01.
