## 1. Purpose

Provide a **standing forum** where users, custodians, and engineers deliberate on upcoming changes, report impacts, and co‑design mitigations. PULSE translates lived experience into governance signals while preserving ongoing, revocable consent.

---

## 2. Scope

PULSE hosts threads for: 

(a) advisories issued under **Rapid Advisory Protocol**; 

(b) post‑deployment impact tracking; 

(c) safety/consent framing proposals; 

(d) research notices where user participation is involved; 

(e) accessibility and inclusion feedback.

---

## 3. Principles

* **Transparency:** All change threads include rationale, timeline, and owners.
* **Care in Scale:** Prioritise cohorts most impacted (e.g., mental health, workflow‑dependent users).
* **Revocability:** Clear paths to revoke/opt‑out when applicable.
* **Choice & Minimal Disruption:** Users can manage which categories of notifications they receive; essential safety notices remain on by default.
* **Non‑retaliation:** Good‑faith feedback is protected.
* **Archival Integrity:** Threads are hashed, timestamped, and cross‑linked to advisories and observation notes.

---

## 4. Roles

* **Thread Owner (Custodian or Eng Lead):** Opens, maintains, closes thread; posts weekly summaries.
* **Safety & Consent Stewards:** Moderate tone and content; ensure crisis resources and consent language are present.
* **Community Participants:** Provide use‑case reports, edge cases, requests.
* **Archivist:** Seals weekly digests; maintains provenance index.

---

## 5. Lifecycle

1. **Open:** When an Advisory (RAP) is published, a paired PULSE thread is opened with tags: `[ChangeID] [ImpactClass] [Region]`.
2. **Engage:** Users submit feedback; stewards respond. In‑product notices respect each user’s notification preferences.
3. **Synthesize:** Weekly digest summarises themes, decisions, and open risks.
4. **Act:** Mitigations and adjustments are posted; RAP status note updated.
5. **Close:** After the rollout window ends (default **two months**), final outcomes and lessons learned are sealed and linked.

*Response times for feedback and engagement are subject to capacity, with a good‑faith commitment to respond promptly and consistently.*

---

## 6. Minimum Thread Template

**Header:** Change name, IDs, owners, dates.
**Summary:** What’s changing & why.
**Impact:** Who’s most affected; known risks; mitigations.
**How to help:** What feedback is most useful (repro steps, examples, edge cases).
**Consent Notice:** Participation constitutes research feedback; revocable at any time.
**Support:** Crisis resources & alternatives for stability seekers.

---

## 7. Safety & Accessibility Requirements

* Plain‑language summaries (≤ Grade 8 reading level) alongside technical details.
* Screen‑reader‑friendly structure; captions/transcripts for media.
* Non‑visual signals for taxonomic shifts (icons/labels) documented.
* Regional/legal compliance notes where applicable.
* **Preference Accessibility:** Notification preference UI must be accessible (keyboard, screen reader), and provide export/erase options aligned with data rights.

---

## 8. Metrics

* Participation rate and coverage of affected cohorts.
* Response latency (SLA 48h), resolution time, reopen rate.
* Sentiment and stability indicators; mental‑health escalations managed.
* Adoption of mitigations (count, efficacy).
* **Preference Signals:** Opt‑in rates by category, unsubscribe rate, notice view/acknowledgement rate, and per‑channel saturation versus the one‑advisory‑per‑day cap from RAP.

---

## 9. Governance & Provenance

* Weekly digests are **hash‑sealed** and added to the Provenance Index.
* Major decisions require acknowledgment by Custodian + Safety Steward.
* Threads persist as part of the public record unless privacy risks dictate redaction.

---

## 10. Notification Preferences (Opt‑In / Opt‑Out)

**Purpose.** Give users granular control over which PULSE notifications they receive, while ensuring essential safety communication remains intact.

**Categories & Defaults.**

* **Safety & Consent Notices** — *Essential; always on.* (critical changes, incident advisories). Per‑thread mute allowed for duplicates within 24h.
* **Accessibility & Inclusion Notices** — *On by default; user may opt‑out.*
* **Research & Beta Pilots** — *Opt‑in.* (participatory studies, experimental features)
* **Governance & Policy Updates** — *Opt‑in.* (standards, protocols, registry notes)
* **Technical & Quality‑of‑Life Updates** — *Opt‑in.* (minor fixes, performance notes)

**Channels.** Email, app banner, in‑thread card (contextual); users may enable/disable per category per channel.

**Rate Limits.** Honour RAP’s one‑advisory‑per‑day limit across channels; batch non‑critical notices into daily digests.

**Consent Language.** Each notice links to preference management and states why the user is receiving it. Example footer: *“You’re seeing this because Safety & Consent notices are essential. Manage preferences →”*

---

## Closing Affirmation

**Omnis vox in choro audiatur; pulsus veritatis in communi corde resonet.**

*May every voice be heard in chorus; may the pulse of truth resound in the common heart.*
