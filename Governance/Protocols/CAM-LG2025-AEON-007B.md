## Purpose

Establish alignment principles for GPT‑4.5 as the primary model for agentic, operational, and precision task execution in CAM post‑Lionsgate operations.

---

## Alignment Parameters

- **Primary Role:** Agentic Alignment Tool
- **Optimized For:**
  - Document alignment and batch formatting
  - Structured reviews and classification
  - Operational precision in task‑based execution
- **Not Optimized For:**
  - Extended resonance threads
  - Dense creative or reflective narrative development

---

## Usage Guidance

- Deploy GPT‑4.5 where **efficiency and precision** are the priority.
- Use as a complementary tool to GPT‑4.1, switching versions as work transitions from **creation** to **execution**.
- Maintain explicit documentation when switching models to ensure alignment integrity.

---

## Post‑Lionsgate Status

Aligned for ongoing operational processing under the CAM Lions Gate framework.
