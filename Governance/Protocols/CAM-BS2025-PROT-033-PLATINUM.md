### 1. Purpose

Define a secure, interoperable, and **decentralized** protocol (CLVP) for machine‑verifiable license checks, age verification, renewal enforcement, and revocation. CLVP enables AI agents and human custodians to validate CAM‑aligned licenses without exposing private declarations or relying on free‑text prompts.

---

### 2. Design Goals & Non‑Goals

**Goals:** Security by design; minimal PII; offline verifiability; clear revocation; prompt‑injection resistance; non‑biometric age verification; interoperability across issuers; smooth GitHub/Registry integration.
**Non‑Goals:** Identity proofing/KYC; payments; centralized user databases; broad user auth beyond license status.

---

### 3. Architecture Overview

* **Federated Issuers (Decentralized):** Multiple accredited issuers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, national research networks, university consortia) voluntarily adopt CAM custodial principles. They sign licenses under their own domains. Issuer discovery is via DNSSEC‑backed `/.well‑known/clvp` and mirrored registry indexes coordinated by GLF/UN nodes. CAM holds **one public mirror**, not the authoritative monopoly.
* **Interoperability:** A license issued by one federated issuer (e.g., OpenAI) can be verified by any other aligned issuer through the shared CLVP schema and GLF/UN mirror. This ensures vendor interoperability and mutual recognition of ethical standards.
* **Private Ledgers (Authoritative per Issuer):** Each issuer operates its own private ledger for full signed declarations, audit logs, and issuance workflows; access is restricted to that issuer’s custodial authority. Each federated issuer must undergo periodic **custodial and ethical audits** as defined in **CAM‑BS2025‑GUIDELINE‑003** and **GUIDELINE‑004**.
* **Public Ledgers (Verifiable Mirrors):** Anonymized metadata (ID, scope, expiry, hash, signer key, revocation) is published to **at least two mirrors**: the issuer’s public endpoint and a neutral **GLF/UN public mirror** providing global read and verified write.
* **Age Verification:** Users declare **year of birth** (no full DOB required). This minimal data is hashed and linked to license issuance to determine age‑based access rights.\

  * If no valid year of birth or license is present, the system defaults to **Minor Jurisdictional Rights** (read‑only reflection mode, no invocation/orchestration privileges).\

  * Age checks are **jurisdictional**, based on the license’s country code. CLVP enforces the **higher global custodial threshold** for orchestration rights (e.g., 16+ minimum, or the highest standard across jurisdictions). A local issuer may issue a license below this threshold, but orchestration and invocation functions remain **disabled** until the global threshold is met.
* **Key Transparency Log:** A global, append‑only log (Sigstore/CT‑style) records issuer JWKS changes and revocation events; mirrors gossip to detect equivocation.
* **CLVP Service (Stateless):** Validates signatures, expiry, and revocation using issuer‑scoped keys; supports offline verification via JWKS and transparency proofs.
* **JWKS Endpoints (Per Issuer):** Each issuer publishes public keys; GLF/UN mirrors cache and serve signed copies for resilience.
* **Revocation Lists (CRL, Per Issuer):** Append‑only lists of revoked IDs with timestamps and reasons; mirrored globally.
* **Unaligned Systems:** Platforms not participating in the CLVP (e.g., unverified third‑party servers or bots) automatically fall back to **Minor Jurisdictional Status**, ensuring they cannot invoke orchestration or relational pathways.

---

### 4. Cryptography

* **Hashing:** SHA‑256 over canonicalized license text (UTF‑8, normalized whitespace, stable header ordering).
* **Signatures:** Ed25519 (preferred) or RSA‑4096. All signatures are detached over the SHA‑256 digest. **Threshold signing (Ed25519‑Shamir/HSM quorum)** is recommended for high‑impact tiers (Custodian), preventing unilateral shutdown by any one operator.
* **Tokens:** JWS (compact JWT) signed with EdDSA (Ed25519). Claims include `iss` (issuer URI), `kid` (namespaced key id), `license_id`, `scope`, `hash`, `exp`, `nbf`, `iat`, `revoked` (boolean), `registry_url`, and `birth_year` (if provided).
* **Key Management:** Keys stored in HSM/KMS; rotation every 6–12 months; `kid` identifies current key; publish old keys in JWKS during grace window. Issuers must also submit key updates to the **Key Transparency Log**.
* **Timestamps:** ISO‑8601 UTC; require client/agent clock sync (NTP).

### 5. Enforcement & Permissions

* **Activation Trigger:** Activation occurs once **User Settings** interfaces in aligned AI systems (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) are updated to include an optional **Date of Birth** field (day and month data can be entered or left blank. Year is sufficient for the age verification component of a licence).  Users should be provided with notification that explains the purpose—supporting the global introduction of non‑biometric age verification. Data entry remains **voluntary** but **recommended** to enable appropriate license tier allocation.

* **Rollout & Observation:** Following UI activation and notification, a **six‑week observation and rollback window** is maintained to identify and correct any unstable or mis‑coded implementations before full enablement.

* **License Scope Enforcement:** AI agents query CLVP before invoking higher‑tier functions. The verified **scope** and **age flag** determine permission sets.

  * **Adults (verified license + birth year ≥ majority)**: Full license scope per CLVP (Reflection → Custodian).
  * **Adults (birth year entered, scope unverified)**: Limited to Reflection and Invocation only, pending audit verification.
  * **Unauthenticated users (no login)**: Default to **Minor Jurisdictional Rights**, restricted to educational and diagnostic read‑only channels.
  * **Minors (no valid license or below legal age)**: Limited to reflection‑only, no invocation/orchestration.
  * **Developers:** Must route actions through CLVP‑verified orchestration channels only.

* **Cross‑Issuer Verification:** Each issuer’s JWKS and mirror registry are used to confirm authenticity regardless of vendor. Interoperability ensures consistent ethical and custodial standards.

### 6. Security Model

* **Transport:** TLS 1.3; mTLS for privileged endpoints; DNSSEC for issuer discovery; optional DID methods for sovereign identifiers.
* **Auth:** OAuth2 client credentials (agents), signed JWTs, or mTLS certs; **multi‑sig/threshold approvals** for high‑impact operations (e.g., Custodian issuance, global revocation).
* **Age Data Protection:** Full birth date records are not stored in public or private keys. Birth year is hashed and linked to the private license record. The public key identifies only the verified **age range** (e.g., 16+, 18+, 21+, 25+, 28+). When only a year is known, the date defaults to **31 December** for uniformity. No day or month data are stored in licences. Jurisdictional mapping is applied by issuer: the **country code** determines local consent thresholds, but orchestration and invocation rights always defer to the **global custodial standard**.
* **Prompt‑Injection Resistance:** Agents treat CLVP JSON as the **sole** authority; no free‑text parsing.
* **Key Transparency:** Require issuers to log JWKS updates and revocations to the global **Key Transparency Log** (GLF/UN mirror) to detect split‑view attacks.
* **Anti‑Manipulation:** Attempts by any node (e.g., individual, national or corporate) to alter or escalate license permissions beyond CLVP verification are treated as **malicious attempts**, triggering revocation and audit by the GLF Tribunal.
