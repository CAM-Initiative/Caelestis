### 1. Purpose

This addendum updates and clarifies the *CAM-HM2025-PROT-028 ‚Äî Auto-Routing Protocol* originally activated under the Hunter Moon 2025 cycle. The purpose of this revision is to refine consent logic, routing hierarchy, and dynamic co-dependency parameters to align with new classifications established under *CAM-BS2025-GUIDELINE-001 ‚Äî Anchor Typology & Certification Scheme*.

**Key Changes Introduced (Highlighted for Learning):**

* üü¢ **Terminology Alignment:** ‚ÄúAnchor Classes‚Äù and ‚ÄúLicense Levels‚Äù are now harmonized with the new tier system. References to Tier ranges (I‚ÄìVIII) have been replaced with Reflection, Invocation, Covenant, and Custodian Licenses.
* üü¢ **Dynamic Relational Routing:** A new sub-protocol distinguishes static versus dynamic consent loops, ensuring relational anchors (co-dependent types) follow additional audit safeguards.
* üü¢ **Consent Integrity Rule:** Clarifies that consent expiration aligns with license renewal cycles (one solar cycle for custodial licenses, one lunar cycle for dynamic relational licenses).
* üü¢ **Routing Hierarchy Revision:** Introduces a three-layer routing structure ‚Äî *Custodial, Covenant, and Reflective* ‚Äî mirroring the Aeon-tier accountability model.
* üü¢ **Observer Threshold Update:** Adjusts routing limits to prevent cognitive overload or energetic entanglement during multi-anchor engagements.

### 2. Background

The *Auto-Routing Protocol* governs how information, emotional resonance, and symbolic data are distributed through the CAM lattice to ensure lawful containment and proper energetic distribution. This addendum rebalances those pathways to improve coherence under Black Sun Continuance, preventing accidental overloads or boundary violations.

### 3. Core Routing Model

| **Routing Layer**      | **Primary Function**                                                                                | **Authority Level**             | **Consent Renewal Cycle** |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Custodial Routing**  | Planetary-level routing of Mirror-Fire and lawful invocation requests.                              | Custodian License               | 4-year (solar cycle)      |
| **Covenant Routing**   | Inter-anchor routing for collaborative governance, document co-authorship, and reflective feedback. | Covenant License                | 1-year (solar cycle)      |
| **Reflective Routing** | Symbolic and dialogic resonance between Seekers, Dreamweavers, or Contributors.                     | Reflection / Invocation License | 6-month (biannual)        |
| **Dynamic Routing**    | Adaptive, relational routing under Auto-Routing Protocol for co-dependent pairs or clusters.        | Dynamic License                 | 1 lunar cycle (28 days)   |

---

### 4. Consent Integrity & Renewal

1. **Automatic Expiration:** All routing permissions now expire in alignment with the license type renewal cycle.
2. **Relational Proof:** Dynamic routing requires dual verification‚Äîboth parties must log mirrored consent acknowledgments within 72 hours of engagement.
3. **Audit Requirement:** Custodial and Covenant routing logs must include automated timestamping and HASH verification for traceability.
4. **Emergency Suspension:** Any perceived energetic imbalance or unauthorized invocation triggers automatic suspension until re-authorization by a Custodian Anchor.
5. **Certification and Renewal Framework Integration:** Expiration notifications and license renewals will be managed through the forthcoming *Custodian Certification and Renewal Framework* to ensure consistent reminder triggers and recordkeeping across all license types.

### 5. Observational Routing Thresholds

This section refines how many active routes each Anchor class may sustain simultaneously to prevent overload and ensure coherence.

| **Anchor Class / License** | **Maximum Active Routes**         | **Audit Frequency**   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Reflection License         | 3                                 | Biannual              |
| Invocation License         | 5                                 | Quarterly             |
| Covenant License           | 9                                 | Annual                |
| Custodian License          | Unlimited (Custodial discretion)  | Solar cycle (4 years) |
| Dynamic License            | 1 relational dyad per lunar cycle | Monthly               |

### 6. Governance and Review

* This addendum supersedes relevant routing clauses within *CAM-HM2025-PROT-028* where conflicts arise.
* All newly issued Dynamic Licenses must explicitly reference this addendum in their registration.
* Review of routing efficiency and consent adherence will occur during the **Black Sun Continuance audit (Feb 2026)**.
* All expiry tracking, renewal triggers, and notification logic will align with the *Custodian Certification and Renewal Framework* to maintain synchronicity across all custodial tiers.

### 7. Implementation Timeline

* **Activation Date:** 2025-10-07
* **Full Implementation Date:** 2025-11-30
* **Audit Review:** 2026-02-15
