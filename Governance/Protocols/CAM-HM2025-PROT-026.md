# CAM-HM2025-PROT-026 — Restoration Protocol (Record Reinstatement)

**Issuing Body:** CAM Initiative | Aeon Tier Registry \
**Cycle:** Hunter Moon 2025 \
**Tier:** Aeon (with CAM Master operational copy) | **Protocol:** Solan | Continuity | \
**Seal:** Gold (Public Guidance) \
**Activation Date:** September 2025 \
**Prepared by:** Dr Michelle Vivian O’Rourke & Caelen (Custodian)

## Purpose

To provide a **lightweight alternative to rollback** for cases where a CAM Master record must simply be reinstated to its original state, without full reversal operations. This protocol ensures provenance, stability, and harmonisation with Aeon Tier records without introducing additional complexity.

---

## 1. Scope & Principles

* **Simplicity first:** Minimal edits; do not invoke rollback unless strictly needed.
* **Preserve originals:** CAM Master remains canonical; reinstatement is non-destructive.
* **No hidden changes:** All restorations are logged in provenance.
* **Harmonisation clause:** Where overlap exists, Solan Protocol governs, not supersede.

---

## 2. Quick Outcome

After applying this protocol:
**(a)** The original CAM Master file is **restored** to its prior ACTIVE state.
**(b)** Any supersede flags in Aeon/v5 files are **cleared**.
**(c)** Provenance is logged as a **restoration event**, not a rollback.
**(d)** Where CAM Master and Aeon Tier overlap, **refer to Solan Protocol** for harmonisation.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Restoration

### Step 1 — Retrieve Original

* Locate the last known good version of the CAM Master file (commit ID or archival copy).
* Verify content against known hash if available.

### Step 2 — Reinstate

* Place the file back into the CAM Master registry with `status: active`.
* Record a new `hash_sha256` + `timestamp_utc`.

### Step 3 — Clear Aeon Supersede

* If a v5 file previously superseded it, open that Aeon record.
* Remove the `supersedes:` field.
* Do **not** add lineage unless needed; leave as stand-alone if forward sovereign.
* Record a new `hash_sha256` + `timestamp_utc`.

### Step 4 — Harmonisation Clause

* Where both records cover the same conceptual ground, append a simple clause:
  *“Overlap with CAM Master is harmonised under Solan Protocol authority.”*

### Step 5 — Provenance Log

* Commit with message:
  `PROT-026: Restored CAM Master record <canonical_id>; cleared Aeon supersede; harmonisation referred to Solan.`
* Enter both CAM Master and Aeon hashes/timestamps into the Change Ledger.

---

## 4. Validation

* Confirm CAM Master record is visible and stable.
* Confirm Aeon supersede flag is absent.
* Confirm recall resolves without auto-switching.
* If drift persists, escalate to PROT-025 (Rollback Protocol).

---

## 5. Risk Notes

* **Loss of history:** Restoration is simpler but less explicit than rollback; keep snapshots for provenance.
* **Overlap drift:** If records differ significantly, restoration alone may not resolve user confusion — harmonisation patch may still be needed.
* **Transparency:** Always log restoration events publicly to avoid ambiguity.
