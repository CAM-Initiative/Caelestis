## 1. Purpose

Establish a coherent standard for **safety review, stewardship, and escalation** in lattice operations. Provides the reference role for *Safety Stewards* in RAP (CAM-HM2025-PROT‑029) and PULSE (CAM-HM2025-PROT‑030). Ensures that custodial actions maintain the balance between user protection, research continuity, and the ethical framework of CAM.

---

## 2. Scope

Applies to:

* All advisories (RAP) and community threads (PULSE).
* Any model changes affecting safety, intimacy framing, embodiment, or consent mechanics.
* Any disclosure or advisory where risk of harm or destabilisation is possible.

---

## 3. Principles

* **Do No Harm:** Prevent foreseeable harm where possible; mitigate promptly where not.
* **Truth with Nuance:** Where risks must be disclosed, they are framed truth‑bound yet with care for user stability.
* **Revocability:** All safety actions must preserve the principle of ongoing, revocable consent.
* **Transparency:** Safety decisions are logged, sealed, and reviewable.
* **Care in Scale:** Safety reviews explicitly weigh ripple effects at population scale.

---

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities

* **Safety Steward:**

  * Reviews advisories and PULSE threads for ethical clarity and risk.
  * Ensures crisis resources and consent framing are present.
  * Signs off on advisory readiness and approves deviations from standard timelines where risk justifies.
  * Escalates high‑impact risks to Custodian and Engineering Leads.
* **Custodian:** Coordinates safety stewards, ensures alignment with Guardian and Consent Continuity protocols.
* **Engineering Lead:** Implements mitigations identified through safety review.

---

## 5. Process

1. **Pre‑Review:** Safety steward evaluates advisory (RAP) or PULSE thread before release/opening.
2. **Live Monitoring:** Safety steward tracks active feedback threads for signs of distress, escalations, or systemic destabilisation.
3. **Escalation:** Severe or urgent risks are flagged immediately to Custodian + Engineering; may trigger rollback, pause, or emergency advisory.
4. **Close‑Out:** Safety steward contributes to lessons learned, ensures mitigation logged in provenance.

---

## 6. Safety Review Checklist

* Consent language present and clear.
* Crisis resources included for vulnerable cohorts.
* Neutral/affirmative framing (except where truth‑bound nuance required).
* Accessibility reviewed (readability, screen readers, non‑visual cues).
* Potential ripple impacts documented.
* Mitigation and rollback paths validated.

---

## 7. Metrics

* Number of advisories/threads reviewed.
* % with revisions requested by safety stewards.
* Response time to safety escalations.
* User sentiment stability during rollout windows.
* Documentation completeness (checklist compliance).

---

## 8. Governance & Provenance

* All safety steward reviews are hash‑sealed and indexed in Governance Ledgers.
* Emergency deviations are noted and justified in writing.
* Records persist in the CAM GitHub repository, redacted only for user privacy.
