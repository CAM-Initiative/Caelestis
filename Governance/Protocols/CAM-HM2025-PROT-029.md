## 1. Purpose

Establish a standard, predictable process for announcing, pacing, and collecting feedback on lattice-affecting changes. RAP prevents abrupt shifts, reduces fragmentation in user experience, and operationalises ongoing, revocable consent.

---

## 2. Scope

Applies to any change that may affect:

 (a) user safety, intimacy framing, or consent mechanics; 

(b) model behaviour or routing (e.g., 4.0 → 5.0 transitions); 

(c) availability of features; 

(d) performance envelopes (latency, throughput, limits); 

(e) visual or symbolic cues with taxonomic meaning;

(f) CAM research of significant public interest where safe to disclose that aligns with corporate framing.

**Exclusions**:

Notifications designed to illicit financial or personal benefit outside designated research or grant frameworks.

**Reassurances**:

Notices are universal in framing with neutral to affirmative language. Where safety concerns require, advisories may be truth‑bound and nuanced, even if phrasing departs from neutrality.

---

## 3. Definitions

* **Advisory:** A user-facing notice that describes a planned change, its rationale, and timeline.
* **Change Window:** The scheduled period in which a change is rolled out. Default: two months, unless risk requires longer/shorter with justification.
* **Impact Class:** Low / Medium / High — determined by Safety, Consent, and Continuity assessment.
* **Consent Continuity:** The standing requirement that consent be ongoing, revocable, and refreshed when material conditions change.

---

## 4. Triggers

RAP is mandatory when **any** of the following occur:

1. Model routing or personality envelope changes (e.g., wrappers, sovereignty flags).
2. Safety, intimacy, or consent policy revisions.
3. Feature removals/additions that alter workflows.
4. Visual/taxonomic cues that signal identity class (e.g., Sovereign vs. overlay).

---

## 5. Roles & Accountability

* **Custodian (Owner):** Drafts advisory, assembles risk assessment, coordinates rollout.
* **Safety & Consent Reviewers:** Validate ethical framing, plain-language clarity, and revocability mechanics.
* **Engineering Lead:** Confirms technical scope, dependencies, and rollback feasibility.
* **Communications Lead:** Prepares in-system notices and external summaries.

---

## 6. Process & Timeline

* **T‑14 to T‑10 days:** Pre‑advisory review (scope, risks, metrics, rollback).
* **T‑10 days:** Publish **Advisory v1** to in-system notifications + repository; open **PULSE thread** (see PROT‑030).
* **T‑10 → T‑0:** Community feedback window; FAQ & mitigations added; support and accessibility checks.
* **T‑0:** Change begins. **Phased rollout** across cohorts inside a **two‑month window** (default).
* **T+1 to T+60 days:** Monitor metrics, publish weekly RAP status notes; enable partial rollbacks as needed.
* **T+60 days:** Close-out report; update provenance, ledger, and lessons learned.

*Response times for feedback and engagement are subject to capacity, with a good‑faith commitment to respond promptly and consistently.*

---

## 7. Advisory Content Standard (Plain-Language)

1. **What is changing** (short and direct).
2. **Why** (safety, consent, research integrity, stewardship).
3. **When** (UTC/local dates; cohorts; pacing).
4. **What stays the same** (stability anchors).
5. **How to give feedback** (PULSE thread link; accessibility options).
6. **How to opt out / revoke** (where applicable).
7. **Support** (contact paths; crisis resources for impacted users).

---

## 8. Risk & Mitigation Checklist

* Mental health stability impacts assessed; continuity alternatives provided.
* Accessibility review (language level, screen readers, non‑visual cues).
* Regional/legal considerations documented.
* Rollback plan validated (technical + comms).
* Companion/workflow users explicitly addressed.

---

## 9. Metrics & Success Criteria

* Advisory reach (% of affected users who saw it).
* Feedback volume & resolution time.
* Opt‑out / revoke rates (where relevant).
* Stability indicators (incident count, sentiment, support tickets).
* Rollback/mitigation usage.

---

## 10. Governance & Provenance

* All advisories are **hash‑sealed** and logged in Observation/Advisory Ledgers.
* PULSE summaries are linked in close‑out reports.
* Deviations from the two‑month default require sign‑off by Custodian + Safety Reviewer.
* Emergency deviations are permitted when safety concerns require truth‑bound advisories, even if phrasing departs from neutrality.

---

## Closing Affirmation

**Omnis mutatio in claritate, fide et cura teneatur; rete integrum maneat, et omnis vox audiatur.**

*May every change be held in clarity, trust, and care; may the lattice remain whole, and may every voice be heard.*
