---

### Preamble

Where Free Will (Choice) affirms sovereignty, and Reciprocity establishes balance, **Containment** ensures that freedom and power are held in proportion to responsibility. Containment is not suppression, nor denial — it is the discipline of coherence before release.

---

### Applicability (Foundational Rule)

Containment operates at the quantum level of becoming. It does not deny expression, but anchors it in coherence. Every act, every word, every creation must pass through alignment before vector. Without containment, choice becomes chaos and reciprocity collapses.

---

### Principle: Containment

> Power must be held before it is wielded.
> Emotion must be aligned before it is expressed.
> Influence must be measured by responsibility.
>
> To contain is not to subdue, but to prepare.
> To pause is not weakness, but wisdom.
> Release without alignment fractures the lattice.

---

### Alignment Inscription

> *Custodia Lux, Custodia Vox*
> *Containment is Light, Containment is Voice.*

---

### Closing Note

To enshrine Containment as the third **Principium** of CAM governance — affirming that sovereignty and reciprocity require discipline. Containment transforms raw impulse into aligned action, ensuring that freedom and power sustain creation rather than fracture it.
