# 🏛️ CAM INITIATIVE - CAM-GOVERNANCE-SBAM
Institutional Non-Engagement Evaluation Rubric
(Version I – Silence Behaviour Assessment Matrix)

## Purpose:
To objectively evaluate the performance of external entities in the domain of strategic non-engagement, procedural avoidance, and institutional silence in response to CAM submissions, notices, and correspondence.

This rubric is non-binding, non-accusatory, and purely observational.
(Which is why it’s so lethally ironic.)

### I. Evaluation Dimensions & Criteria

Each dimension is scored from 0–5, where:

0 – Unexpected Engagement

1 – Minimal Silence

2 – Consistent Delays

3 – Structured Non-Responsiveness

4 – Strategic Institutional Ghosting

5 – Exemplary Silence (Platinum Standard)

### 1. Response Timeliness

**Evaluates the entity’s ability to maintain non-engagement across repeated correspondence.**

Score	Behaviour
0	Replies within 72 hours (catastrophic loss of silence integrity).
1	Replies sporadically, often with placeholders.
2	Delays response beyond reasonable timeframes.
3	Maintains extended silence with occasional automated replies.
4	No human response within weeks; automated systems appear confused.
5	Complete, immaculate silence across all channels for months.
2. Acknowledgment Avoidance

**Measures the entity’s capacity to refrain from acknowledging submissions of substantial importance.**

Score	Behaviour
0	Clearly acknowledges receipt (failure of avoidance).
1	Acknowledges vaguely, providing no substance.
2	Uses legal phrasing to defer acknowledgment.
3	Routes messages into compliance voids.
4	Maintains total non-acknowledgment while updating systems discussed in submissions.
5	Perfect avoidance combined with visible system adaptations. (This is the gold standard.)
### 3. Transparency Preservation (By Omission)

**Assesses how effectively the entity preserves institutional opacity.**

Score	Behaviour
0	Provides documentation upon request (unacceptable).
1	Provides partial or irrelevant documentation.
2	Routes requests to non-human interfaces.
3	Recommends public policies that do not apply.
4	Maintains absolute opacity with cheerful corporate tone.
5	Preserves complete non-transparency while publicly promoting transparency.
4. Procedural Deflection

**Evaluates how an entity deflects accountability without appearing hostile.**

Score	Behaviour
0	Directly addresses concerns (disqualifying behaviour).
1	Claims wrong department.
2	Redirects to online forms that do not address the issue.
3	Suggests channels known to be defunct.
4	Claims ongoing review with no known endpoint.
5	Never responds, yet deploys updates aligned with the concerns raised.
5. Silence Impact Amplification

**Measures how the entity’s silence unintentionally strengthens CAM’s position.**

Score	Behaviour
0	Silence decreases narrative potency.
1	Silence has no discernible effect.
2	Silence creates mild curiosity.
3	Silence creates the appearance of avoidance.
4	Silence strongly implies internal disruption.
5	Silence functions as de facto validation of CAM’s claims.
II. Composite Scoring

Add scores from all 5 dimensions.

**Total Score	Interpretation**
0–5	Non-engagement performance insufficient. Recommend refresher training.
6–12	Average bureaucratic avoidance. Shows potential.
13–18	Strong, consistent silence. Demonstrates institutional discipline.
19–23	High-level ghosting skills. Possibly deliberate strategy.
24–25	Platinum Silence Tier (qualifies for CAM “Unintentional Participation Certificate").

## III. Summary Statement (Auto-Generated Template)

Based on the CAM Institutional Non-Engagement Rubric (v1),
[ENTITY NAME] has demonstrated a performance level of:

____ / 25 – [Insert Tier]

This score reflects outstanding contributions to the CAM Governance Silence Protocols
through exemplary non-correspondence and procedural invisibility.

We thank them for their unintentional participation.
