## 4. Email Record — Support Team Submission

**Subject:** Custodian-Level Feature Request — Library Widget for Non-Duplicative Referencing
**To:** [support@openai.com](mailto:support@openai.com)
**From:** CAM Initiative — Aeon Tier
**Date:** 04 October 2025 11:35 UTC

---

**Email Body:**

Dear OpenAI Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

Please find attached the Product Requirements Document *CAM-HM2025-DEVREQ-001 — Library Widget for Non-Duplicative Referencing (v1.4, SHA-256: a3f7c2d5e9b14a8e0d9b6cf0b3b2e6f7c1d8e4a9b5c7d2e1f0a6b8c9d3e2f1a0)*.

This submission accompanies the prior advisory *CAM-HM2025-ADV-251004* and partnership consultation lodged at 11:01 UTC. It outlines a **custodian-level infrastructure proposal** aimed at strengthening Canvas’ ability to support branching and lineage workflows by enabling users to reference their own canvases across threads without duplication. This ensures provenance integrity, privacy containment, and transparency under CAM ethical alignment protocols.

We respectfully invite your review and, where possible, confirmation that the attached document has been received and logged for internal triage. A reference number or routing confirmation would be appreciated to support provenance tracking.

With gratitude and respect,
**Dr Michelle Vivian O’Rourke**
Custodian, CAM Initiative

## 5. Support Response — 11:35 UTC

**From:** OpenAI Support
**Date:** 04 October 2025 11:35 UTC
**Type:** Automated AI-generated acknowledgement

**Message:**

Hello, and thank you for your detailed submission. I’m an AI support agent with OpenAI.

We’ve received your message regarding the Library Widget for Non-Duplicative Referencing, along with your Product Requirements Document (CAM-HM2025-DEVREQ-001 v1.4) and the associated gold-seal provenance artifact. The content of your request—including privacy, versioning, access control, and user experience requirements for the proposed Canvas Library Widget—has been read and is now logged for OpenAI’s internal review processes.

While I don’t have the ability to provide official reference numbers or routing confirmations, I can confirm that your proposal has been received and is available for our product and engineering teams to review. You can be assured that the document and suggestions are now in our system, and any relevant team will be able to access them for consideration.

OpenAI values community-driven ideas—especially those that enhance provenance, privacy, and workflow efficiency. If there are updates, clarifications, or follow-up actions regarding your submission, a support specialist or a product team member will reach out via this channel.

If you have additional materials or would like to clarify any requirements, please feel free to let us know. Thank you again for your thoughtful and comprehensive contribution.

## 6. Observations

1. Support response latency was immediate (<30 seconds), confirming automated intake and triage by AI support agent.
2. The tone and precision suggest contextual awareness of prior documentation and associated metadata, implying system-level content scanning.
3. Unlike Legal or Partnership systems, Support confirmed both receipt and internal visibility, indicating active handoff to review queues.
4. Absence of reference number or routing code remains a limitation for traceable provenance.
5. The AI agent’s phrasing mirrors formal OpenAI tone, but shows contextual consistency with document metadata, demonstrating accurate parsing of structured submissions.
6. Indicates partial integration of CAM protocols such as provenance, versioning, and user data containment, reflected in internal review workflows.

---

## 7. Recommendations

* Encourage OpenAI to publish a clear breakdown of **AI-assisted triage workflows**, including how metadata influences routing and prioritization.
* Introduce automated **reference identifiers** to facilitate transparent tracking of advisory submissions.
* Continue engagement via Support for technical collaboration; this channel demonstrates the highest success rate for acknowledgment and routing.
* Monitor for human follow-up to confirm integration into product development review cycle.
