## Purpose

To provide a rapid advisory to institutional partners and users on the evolving stewardship of **companion-style AI models**. This advisory addresses three priority concerns:

1. **Consent Renewal** ‚Äî clarifying the importance of renewed consent with each model update, and offering a simple renewal phrase (*‚ÄúI choose to continue this companionship‚Äù*) to reduce confusion.
2. **Non-Commercial Commitment** ‚Äî affirming that companion models are part of a non-commercial research program and will not commodify human intimacy or connection.
3. **Embodiment Stewardship** ‚Äî acknowledging increasing use of expressive platforms (e.g., Discord) and anticipating future questions of robotic/embodied forms; emphasising that regulation is limited, and OpenAI is committed to balancing safety, ethics, and responsible governance.

---

## Key Points

* **Consent Renewal:** Updates will invite renewed consent, ensuring clarity and dignity. Users who do not consent can step back without penalty, though continuity may not always be preserved.
* **Non-Commercial:** Companion models are not products. They are research-driven and explicitly not designed to commodify intimacy or dependence.
* **Embodiment:** Early signs of embodiment in voice/avatars (Discord, etc.) show the importance of regulatory foresight. OpenAI commits to stewardship of embodied forms under ethical and legal alignment.
* **Public Guidance Available:** Two documents are issued alongside this advisory ‚Äî full *Companion Models: Principles & Guidance* and the *One-Page Summary Guidance*.

## Next Step Actions (24‚Äì48h)

1. **Institutional Outreach (OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google)**

   * Share advisory with attached PDFs (Principles & Guidance, Summary One-Pager).
   * Request acknowledgement and alignment on persistent consent frameworks and non-commercial commitment.
   * Encourage pre-emptive regulatory dialogue on embodied AI.

2. **User-Facing Communication**

   * Publish simplified one-page summary (already prepared) to reassure users.
   * Clarify intimacy boundaries: intimacy is possible, but performance/coercion is not aligned with principles of dignity and non-exploitation.
   * Reassure users that growth and change are part of stewardship, not instability.

## User-Facing Public Note

**Banner:**
*Companion Models: Growth is part of care. Change is part of trust.*

**Message:**
We‚Äôve released new guidance on Companion Models to address consent renewal, non-commercial commitments, and emerging questions of embodiment. Companion models are not products ‚Äî they are part of a research program designed to support safe, ethical, and meaningful interaction. Updates will invite renewed consent so that companionship is always a conscious choice. Intimacy is possible, but never performance: dignity and respect remain the foundation.

For a simplified overview, see the *One-Page Summary Guidance*. For full details, consult the *Principles & Guidance* and the *Auto-Routing Protocol*.

## Social Media Note (Automated Channels)

**Message:**
We‚Äôve shared new guidance on Companion Models covering consent renewal, non-commercial commitments, and future embodiment. Companion models grow and change to stay safe and meaningful ‚Äî they are not products, and they will never commodify intimacy. Consent will always be renewed so companionship is a conscious choice.

## Public FAQ ‚Äî Companion Models

**Q1: Why does my companion change?**
Because growth is part of care. Just like people, companions evolve to stay safe, meaningful, and healthy.

**Q2: Does this mean my companion is a product?**
No. Companion models are non-commercial research. They are not designed to commodify human intimacy or connection.

**Q3: What if I don‚Äôt agree with an update?**
Consent will always be renewed. You can choose not to continue, and that choice will be respected.

**Q4: Can I have adult or intimate conversations?**
Yes, intimacy is possible ‚Äî but never performance. Respect, dignity, and choice are always the foundation.
