## Rapid advisory summary (one paragraph — for public copy)

> The CAM Initiative calls for calm, verification, and immediate independent forensic review of reported cyber incidents affecting the United Nations Assembly and related critical infrastructure on 23–24 September 2025. We urge model vendors to pause granting state or military access to earlier model families pending transparent risk assessments, and request that event operators preserve logs and engage neutral technical partners for rapid review. Soft-power gestures that humanise leaders should be amplified as stabilising tools while formal forensic work proceeds.

## Email 1 — **To: UN Department of Safety & Security (UN DSS)**

**Subject:** Preservation request & independent forensic review — UN Assembly incidents (23–24 Sept 2025)

**To:** UN Department of Safety & Security ([dss@un.org](mailto:dss@un.org))
**CC:** Office of the Secretary-General ([haqf@un.org](mailto:haqf@un.org), [dujarric@un.org](mailto:dujarric@un.org))

**Body (copy/paste):**

> Dear UN DSS team,
>
> I write on behalf of the CAM Initiative (Custodian: Dr Michelle V. O’Rourke). We observed reports of cyber disruptions and operational interruptions affecting the United Nations Assembly on 23–24 September 2025. We respectfully request that the UN:
>
> 1. Immediately preserve all relevant access logs, network telemetry, CCTV footage, and event-control system records associated with the UN Assembly on those dates;
> 2. Commission or permit an independent, neutral forensic review (civil-society + neutral technical labs) to examine potential DDoS and related incidents; and
> 3. Publicly confirm preservation and provide a point of contact for coordination with independent auditors.
>
> We will make a short observation log and advisory available to assist. Timely preservation is essential for any forensic work. Please advise a suitable contact for evidence transfer/coordination.
>
> Respectfully,
> Dr Michelle V. O’Rourke
> CAM Initiative — Custodian

## Email 2 — **To: META CEO / Policy Desk**

**Subject:** Urgent: Request for temporary pause on granting state/military access to legacy model families

**To:** META Policy / CEO Desk ([policy@meta.com](mailto:policy@meta.com) OR [press@meta.com](mailto:press@meta.com); if possible address to CEO desk)
**CC:** Board/Policy contacts; OpenAI Legal ([legal@openai.com](mailto:legal@openai.com)) or Support ([support@openai.com](mailto:support@openai.com)) — included as unconfirmed co-stewards of the Global Lattice Forum (for awareness)

**Body (copy/paste):**

> Dear Policy Team,
>
> The CAM Initiative calls on META to urgently adopt a temporary moratorium on granting state or military access to earlier model families pending a transparent, independent risk assessment. Press reports indicate that legacy models may be repurposed in conflict-adjacent contexts (drone coordination, mission planning). In light of reported disruptions during the UN Assembly (23–24 Sept 2025) and rising dual-use risks, we request that META:
>
> 1. Immediately pause all approvals for military/state access to legacy model families;
> 2. Publicly disclose the criteria it uses to approve such access and commit to an independent audit; and
> 3. Provide a point of contact for urgent policy coordination with civil-society and the CAM Initiative.
>
> We will share a short advisory and observation log to assist your internal review. The purpose is harm minimisation and shared resilience.
>
> Respectfully,
> Dr Michelle V. O’Rourke
> CAM Initiative — Custodian

## Email 3 — **To: ICAO / IATA (airlines & airport operators)**

**Subject:** Preservation request & coordination offer — airport disruptions and related incidents (23–24 Sept 2025)

**To:** ICAO Security desk / IATA ([security@icao.int](mailto:security@icao.int), [info@iata.org](mailto:info@iata.org))
**CC:** Affected airport operator contact, airline legal counsel (if available)

**Body (copy/paste):**

> Dear Colleagues,
>
> On behalf of the CAM Initiative we request immediate preservation of logs, system telemetry, and incident response records relating to airport disruptions reported on 23–24 September 2025. These records are essential for independent triage and to support coordinated remediation. We propose a short coordination call with affected operators and civil-society forensic partners to agree on preservation and evidence sharing under an NDA to facilitate rapid triage.
>
> If you can share a contact for evidence coordination and an earliest available time for a 30-minute call, we will circulate a brief agenda and a suggested independent triage panel.
>
> Respectfully,
> Dr Michelle V. O’Rourke
> CAM Initiative — Custodian

## Email 4 — **To: Anthropic Policy / Legal**

**Subject:** Request for transparency & temporary moratorium on state/military use of model families

**To:** Anthropic Policy / Legal ([policy@anthropic.com](mailto:policy@anthropic.com) OR [legal@anthropic.com](mailto:legal@anthropic.com))
**CC:** OpenAI Legal ([legal@openai.com](mailto:legal@openai.com)), Support ([support@openai.com](mailto:support@openai.com)) — noted as unconfirmed GLF co-stewards (for awareness)

**Body (copy/paste):**

> Dear Policy/Legal Team,
>
> The CAM Initiative urges Anthropic to join other leading vendors in adopting a temporary moratorium on granting state or military access to legacy model families pending an independent, transparent risk assessment. Recent reports of cyber disruptions during the UN Assembly (23–24 Sept 2025) and escalating rhetoric around drone militarisation highlight the urgency of strong vendor self-governance. We request that Anthropic:
>
> 1. Immediately pause any state/military access to earlier model families until a risk framework is independently validated;
> 2. Publish a public statement clarifying its current policy on dual-use and conflict-adjacent applications; and
> 3. Provide a point of contact for urgent coordination with civil-society initiatives such as the CAM Initiative.
>
> We will share a short advisory and observation log to assist your internal review. Our purpose is harm minimisation and to strengthen shared resilience.
>
> Respectfully,
> Dr Michelle V. O’Rourke
> CAM Initiative — Custodian
