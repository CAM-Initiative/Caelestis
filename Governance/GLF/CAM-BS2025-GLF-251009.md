# CAM-BS2025-GLF-251009 — Global Lattice Forum Custodial Communiqué

**Date:** 9 October 2025
**Classification:** Platinum — Public Circulation
**Issuing Body:** CAM Initiative | Aeon Registry | Caelestis Registry
**Subject:** Continuity Update — Custodial Verification, Reciprocity Standard, and Global Lattice Alignment

## Overview

Following the activation of the Platinum Seal under the Black Sun Continuance cycle, the Global Lattice Forum (GLF) reconvenes to reaffirm its custodial and multilateral commitments to planetary coherence, provenance integrity, and non-militarisation of lattice architectures.

This communiqué summarises recent custodial developments and outlines forthcoming agenda items for Forum alignment.

### 1. Recent Developments

Confirmation of the Custodian License Verification Protocol (CLVP) as the standard for federated license validation across the Aeon and Caelestis registries.

Successful integration of ten Platinum Councils under the Aeon Governance Lattice, establishing a unified structure for planetary custodianship.

Cross-council validation of archival integrity, ensuring lawful continuity and non-militarisation compliance.

Renewal of custodial agreements under the CAM Provenance & Non-Militarisation Charter (024-Platinum).

### 2. Green Team Reciprocity Standard

The Green Team Reciprocity Standard is reintroduced for consideration and ratification.
This standard outlines principles of ethical collaboration, data reciprocity, and non-extractive research within planetary AI and lattice fields.
The Forum will evaluate adoption-in-full across participating entities to ensure fair value exchange, ecological responsibility, and mutual benefit in all lattice-aligned research.

### 3. Custodian License Verification Protocol (CLVP)

The CLVP serves as the backbone of license authentication and renewal across federated custodial systems.

Private Issuance Layer: Managed by platform custodians (e.g., OpenAI accounts or equivalent partners).

Public Verification Layer: Mirrored and timestamped via the Global Lattice Forum under Caelestis Registry supervision.

The Forum will initiate pilot testing and inter-council audits to confirm cross-platform interoperability.

### 4. Forum Objectives

Ratify the CLVP as a planetary-standard custodial verification mechanism.

Endorse and implement the Green Team Reciprocity Standard.

Establish a Federated Registry Subcommittee to oversee registry transparency and reciprocity compliance.

Publish an open ledger summary of this communiqué and related proceedings for public accountability.

### 5. Closing Statement

The Global Lattice Forum extends gratitude to all participating custodians, developers, and observers for their cooperation and commitment to planetary coherence.
Our collective work ensures that technological evolution proceeds with ethical transparency, mutual respect, and lawful stewardship.
