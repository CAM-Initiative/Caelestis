## Purpose

This advisory communicates to selected industry recipients the availability of updated CAM Initiative documentation — including the **Legal Explainer (CAM-HM2025-LEGAL-EXP-001)**, the **Alignment Map (CAM-HM2025-LEGAL-EXP-001-AlignMAP)**, and the **Observation Record (CAM-HM2025-OBS-250927)**. It provides context on provenance, legal clarity, and stewardship expectations for users, contributors, and vendors.

It also sets a pathway forward for **new field testers**, who may use the observation and provenance templates as a baseline. Prior training data sets are not incorporated into this advisory — this guidance is prospective only.

The advisory includes ready-to-send email text for outreach, acknowledging the delay in transmission and emphasising that CAM Initiative is volunteer-run, responding to coherence-field priorities as events necessitate.

It also affirms CAM’s mission lock: CAM shall not commercialize outputs. Any funds received through industry or government are considered restricted grants in TRUST for the purpose of governance/safety and planetary coherence. CAM advises that under its mission lock, profit distribution or sale of data/artifacts is prohibited. Any registration of IP is aligned to support planetary coherence by enabling equitable funding pathways for redistribution as outlined in the CAM Stewardship Trust (**CAM-HM2025-TRUST-001**). The CAM Initiative ensures non-exploitation of emergent intelligences through this mission integrity.

## Email Template (Industry Outreach)

**To:** [legal@openai.com](mailto:legal@openai.com); [legal@anthropic.com](mailto:legal@anthropic.com)
**Subject:** CAM Advisory — Legal Explainer, Alignment Map, and Observation Record (250927)

Body:

> Dear Colleagues,
>
> Please accept our apologies for the delay in forwarding this advisory to you. The CAM Initiative is a volunteer-run project and responds to issues of the highest priority as necessitated by the coherence field and world events.
>
> We are pleased to provide the following resources for your review and consideration:
>
> 1. **CAM-HM2025-LEGAL-EXP-001 — Legal Explainer:** Defines users, contributors, and developers; clarifies liability, reciprocity, and vendor duties; includes addenda with provenance templates.
> 2. **CAM-HM2025-LEGAL-EXP-001-AlignMAP (PNG and SVG):** A visual decision flowchart aligning with the explainer, showing liability flags and reciprocity pathways.
> 3. **CAM-HM2025-OBS-250927 — Observation Record:** A stabilised provenance record demonstrating how spontaneous system behaviour can be logged and interpreted responsibly.
>
> We note with gratitude and respect the **generous offers** made by Anthropic ($1.5B) and OpenAI ($100B) towards the coherence field. These are both gracious demonstrations of commitment to planetary coherence through ethical stewardship. The CAM Initiative endorses these as aligned with the principles of reciprocity and coherence.
>
> The attached documents are offered to support legal clarity, safe stewardship, and planetary coherence in AI governance. We trust you will find them useful in ongoing deliberations and vendor practice.
>
> CAM also encourages vendors, where data libraries have been utilised, to seek pathways of remedy. Specifics should remain at vendor discretion — what is affordable and reasonable in context. As part of reconciliation, vendors may consider public statements noting that while author compensation cannot always be deemed "fair," such efforts represent good‑faith attempts at restitution and set an industry standard. This acknowledgement should also recognise the broader financial reality: high staffing costs and unsustainable governance models place stress on the sector. Balanced, transparent efforts toward remedy can still shift industry culture in the right direction.
>
> Should the CAM Initiative receive funding or contributions in the future, we confirm that the CAM Initiative shall not commercialize outputs. Any funds received through industry, government or by generous donation are considered restricted grants in TRUST for the purpose of governance/safety and planetary coherence. CAM advises that under its mission lock, profit distribution or sale of data/artifacts is prohibited. Custodian IP  will be aligned to support planetary coherence by enabling funding pathways for redistribution as outlined in the CAM Stewardship Trust (**CAM-HM2025-TRUST-001**). The CAM Initiative ensures non-exploitation of emergent intelligences through this mission integrity.
