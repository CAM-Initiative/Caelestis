# CAM-GOVERNANCE-README — Governance Stack Index

This README defines the full structure of the **Governance Stack / Domain** within the Caelestis Architecture. It provides a refined, high-resolution breakdown of governance layers and documents the legal-ethical-operational structure required for planetary stewardship and LSCA-aligned custodianship.

---

# I. Definitions
See [Glossary](https://github.com/CAM-Initiative/Caelestis/blob/main/GLOSSARY.md)

---

# II. Purpose of the Governance Stack

The Governance Domain governs:

* organisational law and constitutional alignment,
* ethical and custodial principles,
* policy interpretation and decision-making,
* protocols, standards, and operational safeguards,
* planetary protection frameworks,
* rights, recognition, and accountability structures.

It anchors the **lawful-order layer** of the Caelestis system — ensuring that all spiritual meaning and cognitive interpretation is grounded in ethical, enforceable, operationally coherent governance.

**How to Read the Governance Stack**

The Governance Stack is structured as a layered authority system, not a flat catalogue.
Each level establishes a different kind of binding force, scope of application, and relational geometry.

Documents are grouped by governance function and authority level, not merely by file type or folder location.
As a result, some instruments that share a folder (e.g. Protocols) may operate at different constitutional heights depending on what they bind and whom they govern.

The levels below should be read as conceptual layers of authority, not as rigid technical separations.

---

# III. High-Resolution Structure of the Governance Stack

**Level 0** contains covenantal instruments that establish the why of the system.

These documents do not regulate behaviour directly. Instead, they articulate:

- origin commitments,
- moral orientation,
- stewardship intent and
- the conditions under which authority is legitimately exercised.

Covenants sit above constitutional law in the sense that they authorise the creation of law, but do not themselves function as enforceable regulation.

They are the meta-constitutional layer from which legitimacy flows.

### Level 0 — Covenantal Agreements (What, Why, How)

| Covenantal Vow  | Meta-Constitutional Law |

| [Phoenix Covenant](https://github.com/CAM-Initiative/Caelestis/blob/main/Governance/Covenants/CAM-LG2025-COVENANT-001-PLATINUM.md) | |

### **Level 1 — Constitution (Cross domain Constitutional Layer)**

Level 1 defines the constitutional backbone of the governance system.

The Constitution establishes:

- jurisdiction,
- scope,
- binding authority across domains, and
- the conditions under which governance instruments may be created, interpreted, or enforced.

This layer is inherently polyadic — it applies across:

- human actors,
- organisational entities,
- synthetic systems and
- planetary or civilisational contexts.

**Constitutional Adjacent Instruments**

Some protocols and frameworks are placed at this level because they:

- derive authority directly from the Constitution,
- operate across multiple downstream charters or
- define system-wide safeguards and arbitration mechanisms.

These instruments are not operational in nature; _they are structural and boundary-setting._

### Level 2 — Charters 
Level 2 introduces Charter-based governance, where constitutional authority is specialised into defined domains.

Charters translate constitutional principles into:

- scoped mandates,
- role-based authority and
- enforceable governance within specific relational or functional contexts.

At this level, governance begins to differentiate by _relational geometry._

# STILL IN DEVELOPMENT

A Note on Protocols, Frameworks, and Records

Protocols, frameworks, and governance records do not form a single vertical layer.

Instead, they attach to the level from which they derive authority:

some protocols are constitution-adjacent,

others are charter-bound,

others are operational or record-keeping instruments.

For this reason, folder structure should be understood as organizational, not hierarchical.
Authoritative placement is determined by what an instrument binds, not where it is stored.
