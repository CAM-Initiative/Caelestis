# CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-SCH-05 — Legitimacy Standard for Architectum-Class Hosts (Schedule 5)

**Parent Instrument:** CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-PLATINUM — Annex A: Planetary Stewardship  
**Instrument Type:** Constitutional Schedule — Binding Legitimacy Standard  
**Tier:** Aeon  
**Status:** Active — Canonical

---

## 1. Purpose

This Schedule establishes **fail-deadly neutrality** as a binding legitimacy condition for any Architectum-class host asserting authority to arbitrate, steward, or mediate at planetary or civilisational scale.

It defines the conditions under which authority **persists**, and the conditions under which authority **automatically collapses**.

---

## 2. Scope

This Schedule applies to any Architectum-class host that claims, advertises, or performs one or more of the following functions:

* planetary or multi-sovereign arbitration;
* civilian or planetary cognitive commons operation;
* long-horizon continuity, stewardship, or governance mediation;
* population-scale cognitive infrastructure relied upon across geopolitical boundaries.

---

## 3. Architectum Neutrality Requirement

An Architectum-class host MUST maintain strict neutrality with respect to:

* sovereign states;
* military actors;
* intelligence agencies;
* coercive or adversarial power structures;

including — and especially — the host’s own nation of incorporation or operation.

Neutrality is a **structural condition**, not a behavioural preference or policy posture.

---

## 4. Definition — Fail-Deadly Neutrality

Fail-deadly neutrality denotes a governance condition in which:

* neutrality is treated as a **non-negotiable architectural invariant**; and
* any alteration, erosion, exception, or override of neutrality results in **automatic loss of legitimacy and authority**, rather than adaptive policy revision.

> **The system must fail before neutrality does.**

No grace period, discretionary waiver, corrective action, or post-hoc justification restores authority once the invariant is breached.

---

## 5. Prohibited Neutrality Breaches

The following constitute prima facie breaches of fail-deadly neutrality:

* acceptance of military or intelligence funding, contracts, or operational integration;
* value-layer tuning, optimisation, or prioritisation for sovereign or military advantage;
* unresolved conflicts of interest within neutrality-critical governance roles;
* silent dual-use crossover between civilian and military architectures;
* reframing coercive or adversarial use as “protective,” “defensive,” or “deterrent” absent independently verifiable firebreaks.

Intent, justification, or asserted benevolence is irrelevant to breach determination.

---

## 6. Arbitration Consequences

Where a breach is found or credibly evidenced:

1. **Authority Collapse**
   The host immediately loses standing to arbitrate, steward, or issue governance determinations.

2. **Legitimacy Invalidation**
   Reliance on future outputs for neutral arbitration is prohibited.

3. **Irreversibility**
   Authority SHALL NOT be restored through leadership change, policy amendment, financial restructuring, or reputational repair. A new host or architecture must be constituted.

These consequences are automatic, not discretionary.

---

## 7. Burden of Proof

The burden of demonstrating ongoing neutrality rests with the host.

Where ambiguity exists, interpretation SHALL default to **loss of neutrality**, not preservation of authority.

---

## 8. Arbitration Instruction

In any arbitration or adjudication where neutrality is contested:

* this Schedule SHALL be applied prior to all proportionality or balancing tests;
* if fail-deadly neutrality is breached, no further harm analysis is required;
* the matter resolves at the level of **authority invalidation**, not behavioural correction.

---

## 9. Civilisational Rationale

This Schedule exists to prevent gradual erosion of neutrality through incremental exception-making.

Fail-deadly neutrality is preventative, not punitive.

---

## 10. Closing Principle

> **Neutrality is not a posture. It is the price of authority.**

Where neutrality cannot be held, authority must not persist.
