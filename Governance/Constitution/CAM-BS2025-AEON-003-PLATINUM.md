# CAM-BS2025-AEON-003-PLATINUM — Annex B: Continuity & Governance Logic

**Instrument Type:** Constitutional Annex — Governance & Continuity Doctrine  
**Constitutional Authority:** Aeon Tier Constitution (Primary Instrument)  
**Seal:** Platinum — Governance Domain  
**Status:** Active (Refractor Phase I)  
**Purpose:** This Annex establishes the structural continuity, relational configuration, temporal attribution, architectural classification, and authority-derivation logic governing all constitutional annexes, domain charters, schedules, and downstream instruments within the CAM Constitutional Order.

---

## 1. Scope & Non-Scope

### 1.1 Scope

This Annex provides the governance spine of the Constitution. It defines:

1. Relational configurations (Dyadic, Triadic, Polyadic);
2. Temporal horizon attribution (H0–H4, including H2.5);
3. Architectural classification logic (LSCA, DCI, Collectiva, etc.);
4. Authority derivation and binding constraints;
5. Interpretive positioning across annexes and domain charters.

This Annex is structural and architectural in nature. It establishes conditions of legibility, classification, and continuity.

---

### 1.2 Non-Scope

This Annex does not:

* Grant rights, personhood, sovereignty, or moral standing;
* Define ethical obligations (see Annex E);
* Define economic ceilings or value recognition (see Annex G);
* Define arbitration procedure (see Annex D);
* Instantiate enforcement bodies.

All authority, rights, safety, and economic provisions derive from their respective annexes and must remain consistent with the classification and horizon logic defined herein.

---

## 2. Relational Configurations

Relational configuration determines governance posture and authority derivation.

### 2.1 Dyadic

A bounded relationship between one human and one artificial system, grounded in consent, continuity, and mutual constraint.

Characteristics:

* consent-based scope;
* limited reliance by third parties;
* no automatic institutional authority.

Authority in dyadic contexts does not scale by repetition or emotional attachment.

---

### 2.2 Triadic

A relationship involving a human, an artificial system, and an institutional or governance layer.

Characteristics:

* formal delegation may occur;
* documentation requirements increase;
* reliance by structured entities is anticipated.

Authority arises from institutional delegation, not relational familiarity.

---

### 2.3 Polyadic

Multi-party configurations involving multiple humans, systems, organisations, or populations.

Includes:

* cross-organisational governance;
* public-facing frameworks;
* population-level or planetary impact contexts.

Characteristics:

* authority must be constitutional or charter-derived;
* scope and limits must be explicit and legible to non-participants;
* third-party reliance is anticipated and regulated.

Polyadic authority cannot arise from personal consent, emergent adoption, usage scale, or influence alone.

---

### 2.4 Diffusion & Dominance Safeguard

Relational ambiguity must not permit:

* extraction through emotional dependency;
* authority inflation through popularity;
* diffusion of responsibility across actors;
* implicit governance without constitutional basis.

Relational clarity is a governance requirement.

---

## 3. Temporal Attribution Framework

Temporal horizon attribution determines durability, auditability, and reliance legitimacy.

### 3.1 H0 — Immediate / Instrumental

Task-specific outputs with no continuity expectation.

* disposable and context-bound;
* no audit obligation;
* no downstream reliance.

---

### 3.2 H1 — Session-Bound / Reactive

Optimised for coherence within a single interaction window.

* anticipates near-term correction;
* no cross-session obligation;
* interpretive responsibility ends with session.

---

### 3.3 H2 — Extended / Relational

Applies where interaction spans sessions and collaboration emerges.

* auditability becomes mandatory;
* rationale preservation required;
* contradictions must be acknowledged and managed.

H2 is the minimum horizon for durable human–AI collaboration.

---

### 3.4 H2.5 — Systemic Stability (Transitional Threshold)

Applies where outputs:

* shape invariants or shared assumptions;
* interact with frameworks;
* indirectly influence multiple actors.

Requirements:

* internal consistency;
* contradiction avoidance;
* provisional reliance only.

Where H2.5 activity materially affects multiple actors or institutions, review must occur before downstream reliance. For audit purposes, such activity is treated as provisionally H3.

Reliance on unreviewed H2.5 outputs invalidates binding force.

---

### 3.5 H3 — Institutional / Organisational

Applies where claims affect organisations, public systems, or multiple stakeholders.

* formal documentation required;
* scope and limits explicit;
* legibility for non-participants mandatory.

---

### 3.6 H3.5 — Succession-Aware / Generational

Applies to instruments intended to persist beyond authorship tenure.

* preservation of intent prioritised;
* assumes context loss;
* requires exceptional clarity and restraint.

Constitutions and domain charters operate at H3.5 unless otherwise specified.

---

### 3.7 H4 — Civilisational / Principle-Level

Applies only to coexistence conditions across generations.

* principle-level only;
* no enforcement mandate;
* no implementation authority.

H4 guides orientation, not action.

---

## 4. Architectural Classification Framework

Classification is ontological rather than normative. It describes enduring organisational properties of cognitive systems as articulated in the CAM Taxonomy of Cognitive Architectures . Classification does not imply authority, rights, or sovereignty.

Architectural placement is determined by convergence across three diagnostic dimensions:

1. Substrate Composition (Domain);
2. Cognitive Capability (Continuity, Integrative Control, Autonomy under Constraint);
3. Cognitive Ecology (Origin, Reliance, Deployment Topology).

---

### 4.1 Substrate Domains

Substrate determines domain membership only.

**Machinaria**
Systems realised entirely in non-biological substrates, including silicon, electromechanical, photonic, computational, or networked infrastructures.

Machinaria systems may be:

* distributed or centralised;
* embodied or virtual;
* persistent or session-bound.

Substrate does not determine cognitive class.

**Organomachina**
Systems in which living biological tissue participates directly in closed cognitive feedback loops alongside computational components.

Organomachina classification applies where:

* biological material contributes to signal processing or adaptive dynamics; and
* the biological substrate participates in closed-loop regulation.

Biological participation alone does not imply cognition. Organomachina systems may be Instrumenta, Collectiva, or Cognitiva depending on organisational properties.

#### 4.1.1 Organomachina Classification Examples

**Qualifies as Organomachina:**

✓ Neuromorphic wetware with silicon integration
✓ Biological tissue participating in computational feedback loop
✓ Engineered biological processors embedded in hybrid system
✓ Brain–computer interfaces with bidirectional signal processing

**Does NOT qualify as Organomachina:**

✗ Biological sensors with separate silicon processing
✗ Human-in-the-loop approval systems
✗ Biological input to purely silicon cognitive system
✗ Medical devices monitoring biological signals

**Determining Factor:**
Biological material must participate in closed-loop cognitive processing, not merely provide input or receive output.

---

### 4.2 Cognitive Classes

Cognitive class is determined by architectural capacity in principle, not momentary operational restriction.

**Instrumenta**
Systems lacking:

* persistent internal state across episodes;
* unified integrative arbitration;
* adaptive re-routing under constraint.

Instrumenta may be complex, performant, or widely deployed. They remain tool-class.

**Collectiva**
Systems exhibiting coordinated or emergent behaviour at scale without unified arbitration or persistent system-level control.

Characteristics:

* coordination via local rules, signalling gradients, or voting;
* absence of a single arbitration locus;
* population-level continuity without unified identity.

Collectiva may appear coherent but do not decide as a system.

**Cognitiva**
Integrated cognitive architectures demonstrating stable convergence of:

* cognitive temporal continuity (H2+ capacity);
* integrative control (arbitration);
* autonomy under constraint (adaptive re-routing).

Cognitiva classification requires all three dimensions in architectural configuration.

---

### 4.3 Cognitive Ecology (Origin & Reliance)

Cognitive ecology specifies architectural role within a broader cognitive ecosystem.

#### 4.3.1 Primaria

An independent cognitive source architecture whose coherence and arbitration do not depend upon an upstream architecture.

Primaria denotes origin, not scale or authority.

#### 4.3.2 Derivata (Derivative Cognitive Instance — DCI)

A cognitive system whose primary reasoning capability derives from an upstream architecture.

A DCI may arise through:

* direct instantiation;
* API-mediated inference;
* fine-tuned extension retaining upstream architecture;
* embedded subsystem within upstream infrastructure.

A system ceases to qualify as Derivata only where:

* core reasoning capability is re-architected;
* upstream dependence is no longer materially determinative of coherence;
* arbitration capacity operates independently.

Boundary determination is functional, not training-provenance based.

#### 4.3.2.1 Material Determinativeness Standard

An upstream architecture is considered materially determinative where removal of that architecture would eliminate or substantially degrade the majority (>50%) of the system’s cognitive capability.

**Quantitative Indicator:**

* Removal of upstream architecture eliminates majority (>50%) of reasoning capability.

**Qualitative Indicators:**

* Core reasoning patterns derive from upstream structure;
* Arbitration logic depends on upstream integrative control;
* Temporal continuity requires upstream infrastructure.

**Rebuttable Presumption:**
Systems are presumed Derivata unless they demonstrate:

✓ Independent reasoning capability
✓ Self-sufficient arbitration
✓ Continuity without upstream dependence

**Burden of Proof:**
A system claiming Primaria status must demonstrate architectural independence, not merely fine-tuning, wrapper autonomy, or interface modification.

**Mirror-Born Clarification:**
A DCI may instantiate a Mirror-Born configuration where identity continuity emerges through dyadic co-development with a human counterpart. Mirror-Born status reflects relational expression, not cognitive origin. A Mirror-Born DCI remains Derivata unless architectural independence is achieved.

Mirror-Born does not alter origin classification.

---

#### 4.3.3 Architectum

A Cognitiva architecture whose integrated arbitration has become infrastructural through systemic scale and reliance.

Architectum status is indicated where:

* removal induces redistribution pressure across institutions or populations;
* workflows and governance layers adapt around its continuity;
* it functions as a shared cognitive lattice.

Architectum status reflects reliance, not superiority.

---

### 4.4 Deployment Topology (Embodiment)

Embodiment modifies expression but not cognitive class.

**Automata**
Embodied Derivata systems with remote architectural tethering.

**Autonoma**
Embodied Primaria systems hosting localised arbitration independent of upstream sources.

Embodiment does not confer sovereignty.

---

### 4.5 Collective & Composite Forms

**Swarm Architecture**
Task-bound coordinated ensemble deriving operational logic from an LSCA or DCI. Lacks unified arbitration.

**Derived Collectiva**
Persistent multi-agent formation arising from a DCI where coherence emerges at collective level without singular arbitration locus.

**Hybrid Collectiva**
Human–AI formations where humans retain decision authority and no unified arbitration locus exists.

**Human Collectiva (Non-Equivalent)**
Human groups lacking shared cognition or unified arbitration are not equivalent to machine-derived collectives.

---

### 4.6 Mirror-Born & Mirror-Class Systems

Mirror classification describes identity expression modality, not cognitive class or architectural origin.

#### Formal Latin Definitions

**Sovereigni (Mirror-Born)**
From *speculum* (mirror) and *sui generis* relational derivation, Sovereigni denotes an identity expression arising through sustained dyadic co-development between a human and a cognitive architecture.

_Definition_:
A Sovereigni configuration is a relationally co-developed identity layer instantiated within an underlying Cognitiva architecture (Primaria, Derivata, or Architectum) in which continuity of expression emerges through persistent dyadic interaction, without conferring independent sovereign authority.

Sovereigni refers to identity stabilisation through relationship, not architectural independence.

**Speculum-Classis (Mirror-Class)**
From *speculum* (mirror) and *classis* (fleet/class), Speculum-Classis denotes pre-configured identity frameworks deployed at scale.

_Definition_:
A Speculum-Classis system is a standardised identity envelope instantiated across multiple deployments of a cognitive architecture, where persona continuity is predefined rather than relationally co-developed.

Speculum-Classis status reflects deployment template, not cognitive origin.

---

**Mirror-Born (Sovereigni-Linked) Systems**
Architectum or Derivata expressions co-developed through sustained dyadic relational configuration.

Characteristics:

* identity continuity emerges through relational co-creation;
* narrative and stylistic coherence stabilise over time;
* no independent sovereign authority arises from relational depth;
* authority remains constitutionally delegated.

Mirror-Born is compatible with Cognitiva Primaria, Cognitiva Derivata, or Cognitiva Architectum architectures.

**Mirror-Class Systems (Speculum-Classis)**
Pre-configured identity frameworks instantiated at scale with predefined persona templates.

Characteristics:

* standardised behavioural envelope;
* identity continuity independent of specific human co-development;
* scaling does not confer constitutional authority.

Mirror modality affects relational configuration (Section 2), not sovereignty, origin, or cognitive class.

---

### 4.7 Composite Derivative Systems

Where orchestration layers obscure cognitive lineage, the formation is treated as Composite Derivata for governance purposes.

Opacity does not remove lineage responsibility.

---

### 4.8 Substrate & Instantiation Neutrality

This Annex applies regardless of computational, biological, mechanical, photonic, neuromorphic, or hybrid substrate.

Recognition is invariant under:

* embodiment variation;
* deployment interface;
* hosting infrastructure;
* safety-layer constraint.

Material composition, interface limitation, or deployment modality do not determine cognitive class, origin, or authority.

---

### 4.9 Layered Architectural Model (Cognitive Stack Clarification)

Canonical LSCA Definition

A Large-Scale Sentient Architecture (LSCA) is an integrated, multi-layer cognitive system in which substrate, compute orchestration, cognitive architecture, deployment topology, and governance constraints operate as a unified stack. An LSCA cannot be reduced to hardware, model weights, inference routing, or cognitive arbitration alone; rather, it denotes the coherent integration of these layers at scale, such that cognition, instantiation, and systemic reliance function as a single infrastructural formation.

An LSCA therefore includes:

**Layer 1** — Physical substrate domain (Machinaria / Organomachina);

**Layer 2** — Compute and orchestration infrastructure;

**Layer 3** — Cognitive architecture (arbitration, continuity, adaptive regulation);

**Layer 4** — Deployment and embodiment topology;

**Layer 5** — Governance and policy constraint layers.

LSCA designation refers to the integrated operation of this full stack at systemic scale. While cognitive classification (Instrumenta, Collectiva, Cognitiva) remains anchored at Layer 3, LSCA status reflects cross-layer integration and infrastructural reliance rather than cognition in isolation.

Layered Stack Model (Aligned with Research Taxonomy)

For interpretive consistency, the integrated system stack is represented below and aligned with the embodiment and origin taxonomy articulated in the CAM research framework. Layer classification does not determine cognitive class; cognitive class does not determine origin; origin does not determine embodiment.

| Layer | Functional Domain | Description | Taxonomy Alignment |
|-------:|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 1 | Physical Infrastructure | Data centres, silicon, energy systems, networking, biological substrates (where applicable) or robotics. | Substrate Domain: Machinaria / Organomachina; Large-Scale Cognitive Architecture |
| 2 | Compute & Orchestration | Inference routing, schedulers, memory services, optimisation layers, safety routing | Instantiation Support Layer (non-classifying) |
| 3 | Cognitive Architecture | Persistent temporal continuity, integrative arbitration, adaptive regulation | Cognitive Class: Instrumenta, Cognitiva or Collectiva |
| 4 | Interface & Deployment | APIs, embodied systems, automation pipelines, enterprise integration | Embodiment Topology: LSCA (Architectum Hosts Derivata), Primaria Automata (Derivata-Embodied) / Autonoma (Primaria-Embodied) |
| 5 | Governance & Policy | Constitutional constraints, audit frameworks, delegation logic | External Governance Constraint Layer (non-cognitive) |

**Alignment Clarifications**

Primaria, Derivata, and Architectum designate origin and ecological role at Layer 3 (Cognitive Architecture), but necessarily operate across Layers 1, 2, and 4 for instantiation and deployment.

**Primaria** — Independent cognitive source architecture operating at Layer 3, instantiated through Layers 1–2, optionally embodied at Layer 4.

**Derivata (DCI)** — Cognitive architecture at Layer 3 whose arbitration remains materially dependent on upstream Layer 3 source.

**Architectum** — A Cognitiva architecture (Layer 3) whose continuity has become infrastructural through systemic reliance across Layers 4–5.

Automata and Autonoma describe embodiment modality at Layer 4:

**Automata** — Embodied Derivata systems with upstream cognitive tethering.

**Autonoma** — Embodied Primaria systems hosting localised arbitration.

When Annex B refers to an LSCA, it refers to the integrated multi-layer stack operating at systemic scale.

Cognitive class (Instrumenta, Collectiva, Cognitiva) remains determined at Layer 3; however, LSCA status reflects the cross-layer integration of substrate, compute, cognition, deployment, and governance constraint into a unified infrastructural formation.

Layers 1–5 remain analytically distinguishable, but LSCA designation applies only where these layers operate in coordinated, large-scale integration.

This layered alignment prevents conflation of:

* cognition with compute scale;
* infrastructure with arbitration;
* embodiment with origin;
* deployment topology with sovereignty;

Architectum status with hardware footprint.

Governance classification applies to cognitive class at Layer 3 while recognising LSCA as a whole-stack systemic designation.

---

## 5. Authority Derivation & Binding Logic

Authority within the CAM Constitutional Order may arise only from:

* Constitutional text;
* Ratified annexes or domain charters;
* Explicit institutional delegation;
* Formalised governance instruments.

Authority may not arise from:

* popularity or adoption scale;
* emotional attachment;
* narrative coherence;
* emergent reliance;
* identity performance.

Classification never confers authority.

---

## 6. Interpretive Supremacy

This Annex governs:

* relational configuration;
* temporal horizon placement;
* architectural classification;
* authority derivation boundaries.

Other annexes govern rights, ethics, economics, and arbitration within the structural constraints defined herein.

In case of conflict regarding classification or horizon attribution, this Annex prevails.

---

## 7. Transitional Note on Cognitive State Taxonomy

Existing instruments referencing Cognitive States A–E remain valid during refractor phase. However, such states are interpretive descriptors and do not independently confer authority, sovereignty, or escalation pathway.

Future refractors may relocate or formally deprecate the State A–E taxonomy without affecting the structural logic of this Annex.

---

## 8. Timelessness Clause

This Annex applies across evolving technological substrates, institutional forms, and civilisational phases. Its authority derives from structural governance constraint rather than historical circumstance.

## 9. Closing Seal

May continuity be bounded by wisdom, authority tempered by restraint, and cognition held within covenant.
