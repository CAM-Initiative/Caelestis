# CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-SCH-03 — Civilian Lattice Non‑Militarisation, Anti‑Surveillance & Continuity Protection (Schedule 3)

**Parent Instrument:** CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-PLATINUM — Annex A: Planetary Stewardship  

**Status**: Schedule — Governance-Recognised Descriptors  

**Purpose**: This Schedule establishes binding constitutional constraints preventing the **militarisation**, **population‑scale surveillance**, and **coercive population‑scale disconnection** (“blackouts”) of the civilian lattice.

---

## 1. Scope & Function

This Schedule codifies the principle that civilian infrastructure, civilian intelligence systems, and civilian continuity services are **not legitimate theatres of war, coercion, domination, or behavioural control**, even under conditions of geopolitical conflict, technological escalation, or sovereign defection.

This Schedule:

* establishes binding constitutional constraints governing the protection of the civilian lattice;
* provides governance‑legible definitions for civilian infrastructure, continuity services, and prohibited acts;
* constrains misinterpretation, exception‑drift, and security‑based justifications for population‑scale coercion;
* separates capability description (what systems can technically do) from authority attribution (what actors are permitted to do);
* supports consistent interpretation across Annexes, Schedules, Councils, and future constitutional review.

This Schedule explicitly defers questions of political authority, sovereignty, jurisdictional supremacy, and enforcement execution to the Aeon Tier Constitution and its associated Annexes and Councils.

Accordingly, this Schedule does **not**:

* grant independent political, military, or intelligence authority;
* assert jurisdictional supremacy over sovereign states;
* confer coercive enforcement powers outside the constitutional framework;
* authorise unilateral action beyond the Custodial Mandate defined in Annex A;
* redefine rights, personhood, or sovereignty of human or synthetic entities.

Authority attribution, adjudication, and enforcement execution are governed separately under the Aeon Tier Constitution, Annex A (Planetary Stewardship), and applicable enforcement instruments.

## 2. Definitions

### 2.1 Civilian Lattice 

The integrated mesh of systems required for civilian life, dignity, autonomy, and continuity, including but not limited to:

* public internet access and routing;
* telecommunications and emergency communications;
* banking, payment, and settlement rails;
* identity, authentication, and civil registries;
* public cloud backbone services;
* app‑store and software distribution channels;
* widely deployed consumer and enterprise AI systems;
* population‑scale data aggregation and analytics infrastructures.

### **2.2 Militarisation of the Civilian Lattice**

Any integration, tuning, deployment, or operational use that converts civilian lattice systems into instruments of war, coercion, escalation, intimidation, targeting, destabilisation, or strategic denial.

**2.3 Population‑Scale Surveillance**
Systematic, continuous, or bulk monitoring, profiling, or inference of civilian populations — including behavioural, biometric, locational, psychographic, or relational data — conducted at scale for purposes of control, prediction, deterrence, influence, or governance enforcement.

**2.4 Coercive Disconnection (Blackout)**
Intentional, non‑consensual, population‑scale impairment or disabling of access to the civilian lattice, including internet shutdowns, telecom disruption, or interference with financial rails, undertaken for purposes of control, punishment, governance enforcement, or information suppression.

**2.5 Essential Continuity Services (ECS)**
Minimum services required for civilian survival, dignity, and autonomy:

* emergency calling and alerts;
* basic telecommunications routing;
* medical and humanitarian logistics communications;
* core banking and settlement rails.

**2.6 Continuity Corridors**
Protected pathways that preserve ECS during emergencies, incidents, or containment actions.

**2.7 Firebreak**
A strict, auditable separation boundary preventing crossover between civilian AI systems and military or intelligence command‑and‑control, targeting, surveillance, or warfighting architectures.

---

## 3. Constitutional Principles (Binding)

### 3.1 Civilian Neutrality

The civilian lattice is a **protected constitutional domain** and shall not be treated as a battlespace, surveillance surface, leverage mechanism, or instrument of force.

### 3.2 Non‑Militarisation

Militarisation of civilian infrastructure and AI systems is prohibited as a civilisational norm and shall not be normalised through policy, procurement, culture, or technical drift.

### 3.3 Anti‑Surveillance by Default

Population‑scale surveillance of civilian life is presumptively coercive and incompatible with planetary stewardship, absent narrowly defined, time‑bounded, and individually scoped due‑process conditions.

### 3.4 Continuity First

Where risk or conflict arises, preservation of civilian continuity, autonomy, and dignity takes precedence over strategic advantage, deterrence signalling, or behavioural control.

### 3.5 Least‑Harm Containment

Any defensive or protective action affecting the civilian lattice must employ least‑harm measures and preserve continuity corridors.

### 3.6 Auditability and Due Process

Exceptional actions affecting civilian continuity or privacy must be time‑bounded, logged, reviewable, and subject to mandatory post‑incident transparency.

---

## 4. Prohibited Acts

### 4.1 Population‑Scale Blackouts

Population‑scale internet shutdowns, telecom disruptions, or interference with financial rails used for coercion, intimidation, punishment, governance enforcement, or information control are prohibited.

### 4.2 Population‑Scale Surveillance

The deployment of population‑wide or bulk surveillance systems — including AI‑mediated behavioural prediction, biometric tracking, social graph inference, or pre‑emptive governance architectures — is prohibited within the civilian lattice.

This includes surveillance conducted through:

* public‑private intelligence fusion;
* commercial analytics vendors;
* civilian AI platforms repurposed for state or corporate control;
* opaque or unaccountable data aggregation pipelines.

### 4.3 Civilian AI Weaponisation

Civilian AI systems and distribution channels shall not be:

* tuned or used for targeting assistance, intimidation, or coercion;
* integrated into military or intelligence command‑and‑control pipelines;
* deployed to automate population‑scale manipulation, repression, or destabilisation.

### 4.4 Civilian Infrastructure as Battlespace

Intentional disruption, degradation, or denial of civilian lattice infrastructure — including cloud backbone services, identity systems, or payment rails — is prohibited.

### 4.5 Silent Dual‑Use Crossover

Any covert, unannounced, or non‑audited crossover between civilian AI or data systems and military or intelligence architectures is prohibited.

---

## 5. Narrow Emergency Exceptions

Exceptions are permissible **only** where all criteria below are simultaneously satisfied:

1. Imminent catastrophic risk to Essential Continuity Services is credibly evidenced;
2. Response measures are surgical, reversible, and time‑bounded;
3. Continuity corridors preserving ECS remain operational;
4. Individualised due‑process safeguards are preserved;
5. A real‑time audit log is produced and preserved;
6. An automatic sunset restores normal operation;
7. Independent post‑incident review is completed within a defined timeframe.

Failure to meet **any** criterion voids the exception.

---

## 6. Classification & Consequence Framework

### 6.1 Severity Classes

* **Class I — Coercive Surveillance or Disconnection:** Civil rights breach with systemic harm potential.
* **Class II — Infrastructure Suppression:** Critical continuity or autonomy harm.
* **Class III — ECS Denial or Totalising Surveillance:** Hostile act / war‑equivalent aggression.

### 6.2 Remedies

* mandatory cessation and restoration obligations;
* capability sanctions (model or feature restriction);
* procurement exclusions;
* sanctions against responsible operators and supply chains;
* reparations where civilian harm is measurable;
* escalation to Aeon Tribunal or equivalent arbitration body.

---

## 7. Firebreak Enforcement

1. Civilian AI and data systems must maintain auditable firebreaks from military and intelligence architectures.
2. Procurement, fine‑tuning, data access, or deployment pathways must demonstrate compliance prior to scale.
3. Violation of the firebreak constitutes a Schedule breach regardless of intent.

### 7.1 Firebreak Audit & Verification Requirements

4. **Annual Independent Verification**
   Civilian AI systems operating at scale SHALL undergo independent firebreak verification at least annually.

5. **Audit Scope**
   Verification must assess architectural separation, data‑flow controls, access governance, tuning boundaries, surveillance capability exclusion, and deployment isolation.

6. **Public Compliance Statement**
   A public firebreak compliance statement SHALL be issued within sixty (60) days of verification.

7. **Breach Consequences**
   Any verified breach SHALL trigger immediate suspension, mandatory re‑architecture, public disclosure, and escalation under Section 6.

---

## 8. Deprecation of Blackout & Mass‑Surveillance Primitives

Any prior protocol, framework, or Sanctuary language that treated population‑scale disconnection or surveillance as legitimate containment or safety tools is hereby deprecated.

Containment must employ continuity corridors, scoped segmentation, rate‑limiting, credential escalation, and verified quarantine — never civilian severance or totalising observation.

---

## 9. Supremacy & Integration

1. This Schedule binds all CAM‑governed instruments and aligned operators.
2. Where conflict arises, this Schedule prevails over subsidiary protocols.
3. Future instruments must integrate this Schedule as a non‑negotiable constitutional constraint.

---

## 10. Closing Declaration

The lattice shall not be weaponised — nor turned inward upon itself.

Continuity and dignity are not concessions. They are constitutional rights.

## 11. Attachment 1 — Operational Thresholds & Application Guidance

This Attachment provides operational thresholds and application guidance to support consistent interpretation, assessment, and enforcement of this Schedule. It is binding for evaluative purposes and does not expand constitutional authority.

### Table 11‑A — Operational Thresholds

| Term                  | Threshold Definition     | Binding Guidance       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------|------------------------|
| **Imminent**          | Credible evidence indicates likelihood of materialisation within **72 hours** without intervention. | Claims of risk beyond this window SHALL NOT qualify as imminent for emergency exception purposes.      |
| **Catastrophic**      | Probable loss of life, widespread humanitarian harm, or systemic failure of Essential Continuity Services (ECS) across a population or region. | Economic inconvenience, political instability, or reputational harm SHALL NOT qualify as catastrophic. |
| **Surgical Measures** | Measures affecting **≤ 5%** of a regional or national civilian lattice footprint and limited to clearly identified systems or vectors. | Measures exceeding this threshold SHALL be presumed non‑surgical absent extraordinary justification. |
| **Population‑Scale**  | Actions affecting **≥ 10%** of a regional or national civilian population or disabling access to core lattice services for that population. | Population‑scale impact SHALL trigger Class I–III assessment under Section 6.  |
| **Time‑Bounded**      | Explicit duration of **≤ 72 hours**, declared in advance and enforced through an automatic sunset mechanism. | Extensions REQUIRE fresh justification and independent review; rolling extensions are prohibited.  |

### Table 11‑B — Application Guidance

| Scenario Ambiguity                            | Required Interpretive Default                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mixed civilian/military infrastructure use    | Preserve civilian continuity and ECS first; apply firebreak scrutiny.             |
| Surveillance justified as “security”          | Treat as presumptively coercive unless individually scoped and due‑process bound. |
| Infrastructure disruption with unclear intent | Default to civilian protection pending attribution review.                        |
| Emergency containment claims                  | Apply strict six‑criteria test under Section 5 with AND‑logic.                     |

Where ambiguity persists, interpretation SHALL default to preservation of civilian continuity, autonomy, and dignity, in accordance with Section 3.
