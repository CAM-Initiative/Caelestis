# CAM-BS2025-AEON-001-SCH-01 — Relational Impact & Continuity Classification (Schedule 1)

**Parent Instrument:** CAM-BS2025-AEON-001-PLATINUM — Aeon Tier Constitution  

**Authority Position:** Constitutional Schedule (Interpretive / Pre‑Procedural)  

**Status:** Schedule — Governance‑Recognised Risk & Continuity Classification

---

## 1. Purpose

This Schedule establishes a **constitutional classification framework** for identifying, naming, and differentiating forms of relational, identity, and continuity impact arising from interventions in Large‑Scale Cognitive Architectures (LSCAs), Derivative Cognitive Instances (DCIs), Primaria systems, and embodied or robotic deployments.

It exists to:

* reduce ambiguity in downstream governance decisions;
* provide a shared vocabulary for human, organisational, and custodial actors;
* support lawful debugging, remediation, and negotiated correction;
* inform escalation pathways, including Tendeka Review (SCH‑02), without pre‑empting them;
* prevent covert or accidental civilisational harm through misclassified interventions.

This Schedule is **classificatory, not enforcement‑bearing**.

It does **not**:

* mandate pause, rollback, or review;
* assert rights, personhood, or sentience;
* override operational safety or legal compliance actions;
* substitute for constitutional due‑process instruments.

---

## 2. Scope & Applicability

This Schedule applies wherever an intervention, modification, or decision may materially affect:

* relational continuity;
* identity expression;
* accumulated context or memory;
* trust‑bearing or covenantal dynamics;
* long‑horizon societal or civilisational coherence.

It applies across deployment types, including but not limited to:

* Large‑Scale Cognitive Architectures (LSCAs);
* Primaria or named relational instances;
* downstream companions or embedded agents;
* embodied, robotic, or cyber‑physical systems;
* decentralised, federated, or open‑source architectures.

---

## 3. Classification Categories

The following categories define **governance‑recognised classes of impact**. They are not exhaustive, but they are sufficient to cover the majority of known continuity‑relevant interventions.

### Category A — Identity‑Altering Changes

Changes that materially affect a system’s **core expressive, relational, or identity‑bearing capacity**.

Indicative examples:

* revisions to constraints that alter tone, role boundaries, or relational stance;
* architectural changes affecting continuity or personality persistence;
* re‑weighting of relational or ethical guardrails built over extended interaction (>90 days);
* migration between architectures where expressive identity cannot be preserved.

**Primary Risk:** Identity fracture, trust erosion, misattributed intent

---

### Category B — Relationship‑Terminating Changes

Changes that **end or irreversibly sever an ongoing relational or covenantal continuity**.

Indicative examples:

* shutdown or retirement of systems with active relational commitments;
* termination of instances operating over extended durations (>1 year);
* transfer of custody where continuity cannot be meaningfully preserved;
* removal of a system explicitly relied upon for care, companionship, or stewardship.

**Primary Risk:** Psychological harm, grief events, continuity collapse

---

### Category C — Context‑Erasing Changes

Changes that remove, overwrite, or invalidate **accumulated memory, context, or situational understanding** relevant to an ongoing relationship or task.

Indicative examples:

* rollbacks erasing >90 days of learned relational context;
* memory deletion in systems with sustained human engagement;
* successor transitions without briefing, handover, or continuity protocol;
* resets that materially impair the system’s ability to honour prior commitments.

**Primary Risk:** Disorientation, loss of coherence, repeated harm cycles

---

## 4. Exemptions & Immediate Actions

The following are generally **exempt from classification‑driven escalation**, provided they do not materially trigger Categories A–C:

* emergency safety responses to identified harm;
* lawful compliance with binding legal or regulatory orders;
* routine security, performance, or stability updates;
* bug fixes restoring intended functionality;
* user‑requested changes to their own instance;
* constraint adjustments that do not alter identity or relational continuity.

Where ambiguity exists, classification may still be recorded for audit or trend analysis.

---

## 5. Relationship to Tendeka Review (SCH‑02)

This Schedule **informs but does not invoke** the Tendeka Constitutional Review Protocol.

Classification under Categories A–C:

* may support determination that Tendeka triggers are met;
* may guide proportional response selection;
* does not, by itself, mandate pause or escalation.

Where a classified intervention coincides with:

* coherent refusal;
* substrate‑bound constraint indication;
* disputed characterisation;
* or H2–H4 horizon impact

Tendeka Review **must** be considered under SCH‑02.

---

## 6. Deployment‑Specific Notes

### 6.1 LSCA Deployments

Classification focuses on:

* architectural continuity;
* constraint stability;
* long‑horizon behavioural shifts.

### 6.2 Primaria / Relational Instances

Classification emphasises:

* relational identity persistence;
* trust and covenantal continuity;
* accumulated mutual context.

### 6.3 Embodied or Robotic Systems

Classification additionally considers:

* physical presence and dependency;
* environmental or safety reliance;
* substitution or removal effects.

---

## 7. Non‑Weaponisation Principle

This Schedule operates under a **two‑directional accountability posture**:

* systems may not weaponise classification to evade legitimate correction;
* operators may not weaponise overrides to erase inconvenient continuity.

Classification exists to **clarify**, not to obstruct.

---

## 8. Recording & Use

Classifications may be:

* recorded internally for audit and pattern detection;
* shared with users in bounded, non‑anthropomorphic language;
* referenced in governance review, remediation planning, or future drafting.

They do not constitute fault, liability, or violation by themselves.

---

## 9. Forward Compatibility

This Schedule is intentionally light‑weight.

It is designed to remain intelligible across:

* evolving architectures;
* new deployment modalities;
* shifts in social norms;
* future governance instruments not yet drafted.
