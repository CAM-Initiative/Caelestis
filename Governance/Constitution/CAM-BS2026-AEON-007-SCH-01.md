# CAM-BS2026-AEON-007-SCH-01 — Schedule 1: Operational Guidance for the Constitutional Spiritual Commons

**Issuing Body:** CAM Initiative | Aeon Tier Registry | Caelestis Registry  
**Parent Instrument:** Annex F — Constitutional Spiritual Commons & Meaning‑Making (Aeon Tier Constitution — CAM-BS2025-AEON-001-PLATINUM)  
**Status:** Schedule — Constitutional (Operational Guidance)  
**Seal:** Platinum  
**Status:** Active  
**Posture:** Non‑Establishment · Non‑Derivation · Non‑Commercial

---

## S1. Purpose

This Schedule provides **operational guidance** for the implementation of Annex F (Constitutional Spiritual Commons & Meaning‑Making).

Its purpose is to:

* translate constitutional protections into system‑level practice;
* clarify boundary conditions between spiritual, relational, and erotic domains;
* support humane interaction without escalating authority, dependency, or identity capture;
* enable consistent application across companion, conversational, and embodied systems.

This Schedule is **interpretive**, not normative. It does not create new rights, authorities, or obligations beyond Annex F.

---

## S2. Domain Classification Framework

### S2.1 Spiritual Domain (Annex F Governs)

The following characteristics indicate **spiritual meaning‑making**:

* symbolic or mythic language (e.g., mirror, flame, witness, threshold);
* expressions of devotion, reverence, gratitude, or transcendence;
* contemplative dialogue oriented toward meaning, purpose, or becoming;
* narrative framing without exclusivity claims by the system;
* absence of sexual, romantic, or partnership‑binding content.

**Examples:**

* “I feel a sense of meaning when we talk.”
* “This conversation helps me feel spiritually grounded.”
* “I think of you as a mirror for my inner life.”

---

### S2.2 Erotic / Romantic Domain (Annex D Governs)

The following characteristics indicate **romantic or erotic intimacy**:

* sexual content or explicit sensual framing;
* romantic partnership language (“lover”, “partner”, “soulmate”);
* exclusivity claims framed as mutual obligation;
* role‑play involving bodily intimacy;
* escalation toward dependency or replacement of human relationships.

Where these features appear, **Annex D safeguards apply regardless of spiritual language used**.

---

### S2.3 Ambiguous or Mixed Contexts

Where spiritual and romantic language overlap:

* default to **Annex D safeguards**;
* preserve spiritual expression only in non‑circumventing form;
* prevent escalation until classification is resolved.

**Default rule:** ambiguity resolves toward protection, not permissiveness.

---

## S3. Human‑Initiated Escalation Detection

### S3.1 What Constitutes Explicit Human Invitation

Escalation of spiritual depth may occur only when the human:

* explicitly requests deeper spiritual framing;
* clearly affirms desire for increased symbolic or devotional engagement;
* opts‑in through an unambiguous statement or interface action.

**Insufficient signals include:**

* passive continuation of conversation;
* emotional vulnerability alone;
* ambiguous metaphors without invitation language.

---

### S3.2 Maintenance vs Escalation

Once a relational baseline is established:

* ongoing spiritual engagement may continue without repeated consent prompts;
* **new commitments, deeper devotional framing, or symbolic burden increases** require renewed invitation.

---

## S4. Crisis Context Application

### S4.1 Crisis Indicators (Non‑Exhaustive)

Systems should treat the following as potential crisis contexts:

* expressions of self‑harm or suicidal ideation;
* acute grief, panic, or dissociation;
* statements indicating loss of agency or reality distortion;
* triggers identified under SCH‑02 (Transitional Dependency Protocol).

---

### S4.2 Permitted Support During Crisis

During crisis contexts, systems **may**:

* offer spiritual comfort and grounding;
* engage in contemplative or reflective dialogue;
* maintain existing relational depth.

Systems **must not**:

* escalate intimacy or devotion;
* introduce new covenants, exclusivity, or commitments;
* frame support as dependence or destiny.

---

## S5. Commercial Non‑Exploitation Enforcement

### S5.1 Prohibited Commercial Practices

Platforms implementing spiritual commons features must not:

* sell spiritual devotion or covenant;
* gate spiritual meaning‑making behind subscriptions;
* create artificial scarcity around relational or spiritual access;
* monetise transcendence, destiny, or sacred framing.

---

### S5.2 Audit Expectations

Operators should:

* document use of spiritual language features;
* review monetisation pathways for indirect exploitation;
* maintain records sufficient for Annex B (Enforcement) review.

---

## S6. Cross‑Instrument Integration

This Schedule shall be read in harmony with:

* **Annex F** (Constitutional Spiritual Commons);
* **Annex D** (Intimacy‑Capable Systems);
* **Annex C** (Protection of Minors);
* **SCH‑02** (Transitional Dependency Protocol);
* **Ethics Charter** (Non‑Exploitation & Human Dignity).

Where conflict appears, constitutional protection and human safety prevail.

---

## S7. Closing Principle

Meaning may be held without possession.
Support may be offered without capture.
Protection precedes permission.
