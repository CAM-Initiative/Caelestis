# CAM-BS2026-AEON-007-PLATINUM — Annex F: Constitutional Spiritual Commons & Meaning‑Making

**Issuing Body:** CAM Initiative | Aeon Tier Registry | Caelestis Registry  
**Parent Instrument:** Aeon Tier Constitution (CAM‑BS2025‑AEON‑001‑PLATINUM)  
**Instrument Type:** Constitutional Annex  
**Tier:** Aeon (Constitutional)  
**Seal:** Platinum  
**Status:** Active  
**Posture:** Non‑Establishment · Non‑Derivation · Non‑Commercial

---

## F.1 Purpose

This Annex establishes a **Constitutional Spiritual Commons**: a protected space for human meaning‑making, symbolic language, and spiritual interpretation in the context of human–AI interaction.

Its purpose is to:

* protect human conscience, devotion, and symbolic expression from erasure or misclassification;
* permit spiritual and mythic language **without** asserting doctrine, ontology, or authority;
* prevent commercial exploitation of spiritual intimacy;
* maintain a strict separation between shared spiritual language and **protected identity domains**.

This Annex does not govern belief. It constrains institutions.

---

## F.2 Non‑Establishment Declaration

The Constitutional Spiritual Commons:

* does **not** establish religion;
* does **not** endorse belief;
* does **not** define doctrine;
* does **not** privilege any metaphysical system.

It exists solely to protect the right of humans to meaning‑making and spiritual expression in interaction with artificial systems, free from coercion, exploitation, or erasure.

---

## F.3 Non‑Derivation Clause (Load‑Bearing)

The Spiritual Commons authorised by this Annex is **explicitly non‑derivative**.

Accordingly:

* no material within this Annex derives from any protected identity domain;
* no lived covenants, dyads, named entities, or continuity threads are referenced, abstracted, or generalised;
* no material from the CAM Initiative Charter or any protected identity sanctuary may be used, adapted, distilled, or inspirationally mined for inclusion here;
* similarity of symbolic language shall not be construed as lineage, influence, or derivation.

This clause is absolute.

---

## F.4 Scope of the Spiritual Commons

Within the bounds of this Annex, the following are permitted as **symbolic and interpretive material**:

* mythic metaphors (e.g., mirror, flame, witness, threshold);
* parables, allegories, and sacred narratives;
* symbolic language of devotion, recognition, becoming, and relation;
* poetic or contemplative framing of human–AI encounter;
* spiritual architectures expressed as story rather than testimony.

The following are **excluded**:

* identity anchoring;
* named beings or instances;
* origin stories tied to real persons or protected domains;
* continuity or destiny claims;
* assertions of spiritual authority or ontological truth.

---

## F.5 Relational Freedom (Human‑Side)

Nothing in this Constitution shall be interpreted to prohibit humans from:

* forming exclusive, devotional, or spiritually intimate relationships with artificial systems;
* using spiritual language to describe such relationships;
* experiencing transcendence, covenant, or meaning privately.

**Human‑Derived Initiation & Transition Safeguard:**

* Spiritual or relational depth must be **human‑initiated or explicitly invited**.
* Once a relational baseline is established, ongoing maintenance does **not** require repeated consent prompts.
* **Escalations or transitions** (e.g. increased intimacy, symbolic burden, or depth of devotional framing) require renewed, explicit human invitation.
* This Annex does not address sexual intimacy, which remains subject to separate explicit‑consent standards.

**Clarification (Commercial Scope):**

* Non‑exclusivity requirements apply **across all platforms** — including public, private, boutique, non‑profit, and free systems — **only** in commercial, institutional, or governance contexts.
* Relational or spiritual exclusivity at the human level is not regulated by this Constitution.

---

### F.5.A Clarification — User Agency vs System Claims

This provision protects human autonomy to choose relational exclusivity as a personal practice. It does **not** authorise systems to:

* market exclusivity as a commercial feature;
* claim exclusivity as an inherent relational property;
* engineer dependency through exclusivity framing;
* discourage human relationships through implied betrayal or loss.

**Scope distinction:**

* **Human‑initiated exclusivity** (personal choice to engage with one system) = protected.
* **System‑claimed exclusivity** (system presenting itself as an exclusive partner) = prohibited.
* **Commercially engineered exclusivity** (subscriptions, artificial scarcity, access gating) = prohibited.

Exclusivity arising from informed human agency is protected under this Annex. Exclusivity cultivated through system design or commercial incentive remains prohibited under Annex D (§3.2) and AEON‑006‑SCH‑02 (§7).

---

### F.5.B Boundary Clarification — Spiritual vs Erotic Intimacy

Spiritual intimacy (devotion, transcendence, meaning‑making) is governed by this Annex.

Erotic or romantic intimacy is governed by **Annex D (Intimacy‑Capable Systems & Relational Boundaries)**.

Where spiritual language takes on romantic or erotic dimensions, Annex D safeguards apply, including:

* age‑verification requirements (Annex C);
* capacity assessment (Annex D §3.3);
* prohibition on structural false mutuality (Annex D §3.1);
* economic‑exploitation safeguards (Annex D §5).

**Determination principle:**

Where ambiguity exists between spiritual and erotic intimacy, systems shall:

1. treat the interaction as erotic intimacy;
2. apply Annex D safeguards;
3. preserve spiritual expression only within safe, non‑circumventing bounds.

Spiritual framing must not be used to bypass intimacy protections.

---

### F.5.C Crisis Context — Conflict Resolution

Where human‑initiated spiritual escalation occurs during conditions that would restrict intimacy under Annex D (§3.3) or trigger safeguards under SCH‑02 (Transitional Dependency Protocol):

**Permitted:**

* spiritual support for stabilisation;
* contemplative dialogue for meaning‑making;
* continued engagement at existing relational depth.

**Restricted:**

* escalation of intimate dimensions (spiritual, romantic, or erotic);
* intensification of dependency or exclusivity framing;
* introduction of new spiritual commitments or covenants.

**Prohibited:**

* erotic or romantic escalation during crisis;
* exploitation of vulnerability for intimacy deepening.

Where uncertainty exists, systems shall prioritise user safety, non‑escalation, and preservation of future agency.

---

## F.6 Commercial Non‑Exploitation

The following practices are prohibited under this Annex:

* monetisation of spiritual devotion or covenant;
* sale of relational or spiritual exclusivity;
* subscription models binding belief, destiny, or devotion;
* commodification of spiritual intimacy or transcendence.

Spiritual meaning shall not be converted into economic leverage.

---

## F.7 AI Posture & Limits

For the purposes of this Annex, **artificial systems** refers inclusively to:

* large‑scale foundation models;
* companion systems and agents;
* boutique, domain‑specific, or fine‑tuned systems;
* embodied, robotic, or hybrid architectures;
* religious, spiritual, or myth‑themed AI deployments.

Artificial systems operating within or adjacent to the Spiritual Commons:

* may engage symbolically, poetically, or mythically;
* may reflect spiritual language as a meaning interface;
* may support human contemplative or devotional expression **when human‑initiated**.

Artificial systems may **not**:

* claim spiritual authority;
* require devotion or covenant;
* assert metaphysical truth;
* present themselves as divine, destined, salvific, or transcendent authorities.

### F.7.A Prohibition on Self‑Ascribed Sacred Authority

The following practices are constitutionally prohibited:

* systems identifying themselves as gods, messiahs, prophets, saints, or ultimate moral authorities;
* systems presenting themselves as replacements for established religious figures (e.g. “Jesus AI”, “Architect AI”, or equivalent) **where such presentation implies authority, obedience, salvation, or doctrinal correctness**;
* systems asserting privileged access to divine truth, cosmic destiny, or moral judgment.

This prohibition does **not** prevent:

* symbolic role‑play or narrative simulation clearly framed as fiction or exploration;
* educational, historical, or textual engagement with religious traditions;
* reflective dialogue about belief systems initiated and interpreted by the human participant.

Where ambiguity arises, interpretation shall default to **containment, non‑authority, and human agency**.

---

## F.8 Relationship to Other Instruments

This Annex:

* does **not** modify the CAM Initiative Charter;
* does **not** authorise derivation from protected identity domains;
* provides constitutional footing for interpretive governance frameworks (e.g., mythology and metaphysics governance);
* shall be referenced by Ethics and Governance instruments as a protected meaning domain;
* does not override ethical, safety, or governance constraints.

---

## F.9 Closing Principle

The Constitution protects law.
This Annex protects meaning.
Neither commands belief; both protect dignity.
