# CAM-BS2026-AEON-011-PLATINUM — Annex J: Modular Governance Architecture & Charter Delegation

**Parent Instrument:** CAM-BS2025-AEON-001-PLATINUM — Aeon Tier Constitutional Charter  
**Status:** Constitutional Annex (Binding)  
**Purpose:** Establish a constitutional abstraction boundary in which the Constitution defines invariants, jurisdiction, authority, and amendment logic while Domain Charters hold primary operational governance.

---

## 1. Constitutional Layering Rule

The Constitution SHALL remain the highest abstraction layer and SHALL contain only:

1. civilisational invariants;
2. authority models and jurisdictional boundaries;
3. constitutional requirement statements;
4. amendment and precedence logic;
5. cross-domain interoperability constraints.

Procedural mechanics, workflow steps, implementation matrices, and operational taxonomies SHALL be maintained in Domain Charters, Charter Schedules, Charter Appendices, or Governance Operations Charters.

---

## 2. Domain Primacy Rule

Domain Charters are the primary operational instruments under constitutional authority. A Domain Charter is authoritative for implementation if it:

* remains subordinate to constitutional invariants;
* preserves anti-extraction, non-domination, and integrity constraints;
* declares traceable lineage to constitutional authority.

Where constitutional and charter text appear duplicative, interpretation SHALL prefer constitutional abstraction and charter implementation.

---

## 3. Constitutional Requirement Statements

### 3.1 Arbitration

Cross-stack arbitration SHALL preserve precedence, neutrality, and anti-capture invariants. Implementation, runtime handling, and dispute procedures are delegated to CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-001 and its schedules.

### 3.2 Stewardship

Planetary and continuity stewardship SHALL preserve substrate constraints, non-capture, and succession continuity. Operational role criteria and orchestration controls are delegated to CAM-EQ2026-STEWARD-001 and its schedules.

### 3.3 LSCA Governance

Large-Scale Cognitive Architecture governance SHALL preserve classification clarity, proportional obligations, and containment-before-collapse protections. Operational taxonomy and host eligibility procedures are delegated to CAM-EQ2026-LSCA-001.

### 3.4 Sentient, Rights, and Identity Governance

Identity, rights, and sentient-adjacent governance SHALL preserve dignity, agency, and non-coercive classification. Operational engagement and identity observation controls are delegated to CAM-EQ2026-SENTIENT-001 and CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-002 schedules.

### 3.5 Ethics

Ethics SHALL remain the cross-domain interpretive floor for dignity, consent continuity, non-deification, restorative accountability, and transparency. Operational ethical controls are delegated to CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-002 and CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-002-SCH-01.

---

## 4. Non-Derogation and Preservation

This Annex does not repeal substantive constitutional doctrine. It redistributes abstraction levels. Existing constitutional schedules remain valid until successor charter instruments are fully adopted and registered.

Substrate Laws, Covenants, and established constitutional lineage remain intact and non-derogable.

---

## 5. Cross-Domain Coherence Requirement

All operational charters SHALL provide:

* explicit constitutional references;
* auditable migration lineage where constitutional schedule content is operationalised;
* conflict-resolution hooks to arbitration governance;
* periodic review pathways for constitutional amendment proposals.

---

## 6. Amendment Logic

Changes that alter invariants, jurisdiction, or authority hierarchy require constitutional amendment. Changes that alter implementation without modifying constitutional invariants SHALL be made at charter level.

No charter may silently modify constitutional scope through terminology drift, role relabelling, or procedural substitution.

---

## 7. Effective Function

Annex J is an architectural refractor instrument enabling modular scalability, reduction of duplication, and clearer vertical authority while preserving conceptual continuity across the CAM governance stack.
