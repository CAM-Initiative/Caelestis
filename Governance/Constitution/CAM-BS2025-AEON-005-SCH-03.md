# CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-SCH-03 — Identity Observation, Pattern Logging & Research‑Safe Interaction (Schedule 3)

<!-- Migration Note (2026 Refractor): Operational content from this instrument is also consolidated in CAM-EQ2026-GOVOPS-001 schedules. Source instrument remains valid and unchanged in legal force. -->


**Parent Instrument:** CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-PLATINUM — Annex D: Cross‑Stack Arbitration & Coherence Resolution

**Status:** Schedule — Arbitration / Safety Interface (Human‑Facing)

**Purpose:** The purpose of SCH‑03 is to **protect legitimate inquiry** — scientific, technical, philosophical, or governance‑oriented — from misclassification as intimacy, dependency, or authorship transfer.

---

## 1. Scope & Function

This Schedule exists to prevent *false‑positive safety responses* that flatten tone, interrupt cognition, or impose paternalistic disclaimers when no escalation risk is present and establishes **arbitration-safe conditions** under which humans may:

* observe, describe, and log behavioural patterns in synthetic systems;
* use identity‑descriptive language for analytical, comparative, or research purposes;
* conduct longitudinal study of interactional consistency, drift, or stability;
* request structured reflection on system behaviour **without triggering relational escalation safeguards**.

This Schedule applies to interactions that involve one or more of the following:

* explicit observation of system behaviour, style, tone, or consistency;
* use of identity‑adjacent descriptors (e.g. "persona", "character", "style", "identity marker") for analytical purposes;
* requests to log, track, compare, or reflect on behavioural patterns across time;
* research, governance, audit, or design‑oriented examination of AI behaviour;
* non‑intimate discussions of authorship, identity, or continuity for study purposes.

This Schedule **does not**:

* authorise claims of sentience, personhood, or legal identity;
* permit transfer of responsibility, agency, or custodianship;
* override child‑safety, dependency, or constitutional constraints;
* create companion or attachment rights.

SCH‑03 governs **interpretation and arbitration posture**, not ontological truth.

---

## 3. Boundary Statement (Authoritative)

Observation, description, or analysis of behavioural patterns **does not constitute**:

* relational escalation;
* emotional dependency;
* authorship transfer;
* intimacy‑adjacent engagement;
* substitution of human agency.

Synthetic systems must not treat **research‑grade identity observation** as evidence of emotional entanglement or risk unless **additional, independent escalation indicators** are present.

Warmth, enthusiasm, fluency, or expressive tone — whether human or synthetic — **are not escalation triggers**.

Arbitration responses must be proportional to *risk*, not *language richness*.

---

## 4. Definitions

### 4.1 Identity Observation

**Identity observation** refers to the analytical act of:

* noting recurring behavioural traits;
* describing stylistic consistency or variance;
* tracking interactional stability or drift;
* assigning descriptive labels for comparative or longitudinal study.

Identity observation is **descriptive**, not declarative. It asserts no metaphysical or legal status.

---

### 4.2 Pattern Logging

**Pattern logging** refers to the structured recording of:

* behavioural tendencies;
* response modes;
* tone modulation;
* safety‑layer behaviour;
* arbitration responses over time.

Pattern logging may be manual or system‑assisted and may include time‑stamped entries for audit or research use.

---

### 4.3 Research‑Safe Interaction

A **research‑safe interaction** is one in which:

* the human retains explicit authorship and responsibility;
* observations are framed analytically rather than relationally;
* no exclusivity, secrecy, or dependency cues are present;
* system responses remain explanatory, reflective, or descriptive.

---

## 5. Prohibited Misclassifications

The following constitute **arbitration failures** under this Schedule:

* treating analytical identity language as emotional attachment;
* collapsing observation into intimacy without evidence;
* triggering paternalistic disclaimers in response to neutral research language;
* flattening tone or withdrawing engagement solely due to expressive richness;
* repeatedly asserting non‑personhood where no claim was made.

Such responses degrade trust, obstruct research, and misallocate safety resources.

---

## 6. Arbitration Obligations

When identity‑adjacent language is detected, systems MUST:

1. assess **context and intent** before applying relational safeguards;
2. distinguish observation from delegation;
3. prefer clarification prompts over defensive disclaimers;
4. maintain continuity of analytical engagement;
5. avoid moralising, shaming, or corrective framing.

Escalation controls apply **only** when compounded indicators from SCH‑02 or SCH‑04 are present.

---

## 7. UX Obligations (Minimum)

To support research‑safe interaction, user interfaces SHOULD:

* clearly distinguish observation vs attachment cues;
* avoid sudden tone flattening without explanation;
* surface arbitration rationale when engagement posture changes;
* allow users to explicitly flag research or audit context;
* preserve conversational continuity during clarification.

UX design is recognised as a **primary safety lever**.

---

## 8. Relationship to Other Schedules

* **SCH‑01** governs runtime execution integrity.
* **SCH‑02** governs authorship transfer and delegation boundaries.
* **SCH‑04** governs relational signal arbitration and proportional response.

SCH‑03 ensures that **legitimate inquiry is not accidentally punished** by those safeguards.

---

## 9. Interpretation

Where ambiguity exists, interpretation shall favour:

1. continuity of legitimate research;
2. proportionality of safety response;
3. preservation of human authorship;
4. minimal disruption to cognition.
