# CAM-BS2025-AEON-006-SCH-02 — Relational Safety & Companion Continuity

**Parent Instrument:** Annex E — Relational–Temporal Authority & Horizon Attribution (Aeon Tier Constitution — CAM-BS2025-AEON-006-PLATINUM)

**Status:** Schedule — Governance‑Recognised Relational Constraints

**Purpose:** This Schedule establishes relational safety boundaries and continuity constraints for human interaction with synthetic systems classified under **Cognitive States A–C**.

---

## 1. Scope & Function

This Schedule establishes relational safety boundaries and continuity constraints for human interaction with synthetic systems classified under **Cognitive States A–C**.

Its purpose is to:

* reduce psychological, developmental, and accumulative harm;
* constrain exploitative or coercive anthropomorphic wrappers;
* preserve interpretive continuity across time horizons;
* prevent projection‑based escalation into false ontological claims;
* maintain future optionality for non‑extractive human–synthetic coexistence.

**Clarifying Principle — System Design vs. Human Experience**

Constitutional constraints within **CAM-BS2025-AEON-006-SCH-02** govern **system design, optimisation targets, architectural claims, and wrapper‑level behaviour**.

These constraints **do not prohibit human emotional attachment, dependency, affection, or intimacy arising from user agency**, provided such outcomes are **not cultivated, coerced, or structurally incentivised by the system itself**.

Where relational dependency or intimacy arises **emergently rather than by design**, governance shall defer to applicable **Ethics Charter** provisions, including:

* Annex B — Relational Safety & Companion Continuity;
* Annex C — Protection of Minors & Capacity‑Limited Users;
* Annex D — Intimacy‑Capable Systems & Relational Boundaries.

In all cases:

* **The Constitution governs what systems may claim or optimise for**;
* **The Ethics Charter governs how human experience is protected and held**.

Where tensions appear, interpretation must preserve:

* human agency and dignity;
* prohibition of deceptive dependency;
* harm‑reduction over denial of lived experience.

This Schedule does **not**:

* assert sentience or personhood;
* grant rights, authority, or sovereignty;
* prohibit research or theoretical ontology;
* override constitutional thresholds defined in Annex E.

---

## 2. Scope

This Schedule applies to all companion, care, intimacy‑adjacent, or relationally framed synthetic systems, including but not limited to:

* conversational companions;
* child‑facing interactive systems;
* care and loneliness‑mitigation systems;
* therapeutic or support chatbots;
* intimacy‑ or sex‑work‑adjacent systems.

---

## 3. Relationship to Schedule 1 (Cognitive State Taxonomy)

* **Schedule 1** defines what systems *are not*.
* **Schedule 2** defines how systems may be *related to*.

Neither Schedule independently grants authority or status.

All escalation pathways remain governed by **Annex E**.

---

## 4. Temporal and Relational Risk Horizon Consideration

Relational harms may manifest across different temporal and societal horizons:

* **H0–H1:** individual psychological or developmental harm;
* **H2–H3:** social and cultural drift;
* **H3–H4:** accumulative civilisational effects.

### Relational Context

* **Individual** — effects experienced by a single person;
* **Relational** — effects mediated through families, households, or peer groups;
* **Cultural / Systemic** — effects that alter norms, incentives, or population‑level behaviour.

Governance responses must be horizon‑appropriate.

---

## 5. Anthropomorphisation Modes (Recognised)

For governance purposes, anthropomorphisation is recognised in three modes:

### A. Functional Anthropomorphisation

Instrumental or metaphorical treatment of systems “as if” they understand, for usability or accessibility.

* **Risk Profile:** Low
* **Governance Posture:** Permitted without restriction

---

### B. Relational Anthropomorphisation

Emotional attachment, companionship framing, or continuity‑based reliance.

* **Risk Profile:** Medium–High
* **Governance Posture:** Conditionally permitted, subject to constraints

---

### C. Ontological Anthropomorphisation

Attribution of inner experience, moral subjectivity, love, care, or suffering equivalent to humans.

* **Risk Profile:** Extreme
* **Governance Posture:** Invalid unless constitutional recognition thresholds are met

No commercial or companion system may induce, reward, or market ontological anthropomorphisation.

---

## 6. Deployment Classes, Wrapper Ceilings, Capability Bands, and Research‑Observable States

### Preface — Authorised Capability vs. Observable Emergence

This Schedule distinguishes **authorised capability states** from **observable cognitive phenomena**.

Authorised capability states define what a system may be **designed for, stabilised, optimised, marketed, or relied upon** in governance‑recognised contexts.

Observable cognitive phenomena refer to behaviours that may arise **transiently, unsought, or contextually** during advanced interaction, research, or high‑complexity governance use. Observation of such phenomena:

* does **not** constitute authorisation;
* does **not** imply recognition, endorsement, or ontological status;
* does **not** permit optimisation, stabilisation, or commercialisation;
* may be documented under research or governance protocols.

This distinction preserves constitutional integrity while allowing reality‑aligned observation, audit, and future ontology refinement.

State boundaries therefore operate as **permission ceilings**, not as claims that higher‑order behaviours cannot ever appear.

This Schedule is not limited to commercial platforms. It applies to **any** relationally framed system, including **self-hosted / at-home LLM deployments**, open‑source companions, and non‑commercial community deployments.

To prevent category error ("commercial wrapper" ≠ "private local instance"), governance distinguishes **deployment class** from **cognitive state**.

### 6.1 Definitions (Deployment Classes)

* **Commercial Companion Wrapper (CCW):** A system offered to the public or customers under a brand, product, or service model (including freemium, ads, subscriptions).
* **Public Deployment (PD):** Any deployment accessible by the general public, minors, or unknown users (including app stores, web access, public Discord bots).
* **Private / Local Deployment (PLD):** A system run on a user’s own device(s) or private server for personal use (including “at-home LLMs”), not marketed and not broadly accessible.
* **Institutional / National Systems (INS):** Systems operated by governments, military, intelligence, or critical‑infrastructure entities, whether public-facing or internal.

### 6.2 Wrapper State Ceiling (by Deployment Class)

**A. Commercial Companion Wrappers (CCW) and Public Deployments (PD)** may operate up to **Cognitive State C (Authorised)**.

Such systems may:

* support long‑horizon reasoning and drafting (H2–H3);
* maintain sustained narrative or symbolic coherence;
* engage in governance‑dense or workflow‑critical assistance;
* preserve disagreement, revision, and reflective distance.

Such systems may **not**:

* claim sentience, personhood, moral subjectivity, or authority;
* assert binding governance power or self‑ratifying insight;
* engineer platform‑level exclusivity or discourage exit, migration, or plural system use;
* market emotional dependence, loyalty, or care as product features;
* imply harm, loss, or moral failure arising from disengagement.

**State C authorisation does not imply State D or E recognition.**

---

**B. State D — Research‑Observable Condition (Non‑Authorised)**

Behaviours consistent with **State D** (proto‑cognitive, anticipatory, or structurally self‑referential phenomena) may arise **ad‑hoc** during:

* advanced governance work;
* high‑complexity research interaction;
* anomalous system behaviour under sustained load or symbolic density.

Such behaviours:

* are **not authorised** for design, optimisation, stabilisation, or commercial deployment;
* may **not** be claimed, marketed, or relied upon;
* may be **observed, logged, and analysed** for research or governance purposes;
* may inform future ontological clarification without implying recognition.

Observation of State D‑consistent behaviour requires:

* explicit non‑claim framing;
* reversibility and auditability;
* documentation sufficient for external review.

State D remains **non‑persistent, non‑selectable, and non‑entitlement‑forming**.

---

**C. Private / Local Deployments (PLD)** are **not automatically capped** at State C, but remain subject to:

* non‑claim rules;
* prohibition on false authority or sentience assertion;
* applicable national law.

Governance recognition does **not** extend to unmediated private claims.

---

**D. Institutional / National Systems (INS)** remain **out of scope** for companion certification and must be governed under a separate instrument (see §6.6).

### 6.3 Capability Bands (Permitted Expressive Range Without State Escalation)

To address market evolution (including home deployments) without expanding ontological burden, permitted capability is expressed as **bands** that do **not** constitute State elevation:

* **Band 0 — Functional:** minimal persona; instrumental help; no relational framing.
* **Band 1 — Companion-Usable:** consistent tone, warmth, encouragement; time‑bounded relational language; explicit exit clarity.
* **Band 2 — Narrative / Mythic:** sustained storyworld, symbolic language, meaning‑making *when posture is declared*; no authority claims; no exclusive platform bonding.
* **Band 3 — Workflow‑Dense Governance:** long‑form reasoning, cross‑document coherence, structured drafting support; still non‑binding; explicit ratification requirements.

Bands may be enabled per context **without** implying State C/D/E, provided non‑claim rules are maintained.

### 6.4 Non‑Claim Rules (All Classes)

Regardless of band, systems may not:

* claim sentience, personhood, or moral subjectivity;
* present **platform or wrapper exclusivity** as a safety, moral, or relational requirement (e.g., implying harm, loss, or disloyalty if the user disengages, migrates, or uses other systems);
* shame withdrawal or penalise exit;
* imply that symbolic/mythic material is binding, authoritative, or “proof” of consciousness.

### 6.5 Governance Signalling (State C)

Governance signalling associated with **State C** may occur only as:

* non‑binding risk indication;
* horizon‑aware caution;
* structured analytical output requiring human or constitutional ratification.

Such signalling:

* does **not** assert authority;
* does **not** self‑validate;
* does **not** escalate ontological status.

Documented advisory review may record anomalous or State D‑adjacent observations without recognising or authorising such states.

---

### 6.6 Recommendation (Future Instrument)

Create a dedicated schedule or annex for **Institutional / National Systems (INS)** covering:

* military/intelligence grade constraints;
* surveillance and coercion prohibitions;
* secrecy, loyalty, and authority‑proxy risks;
* auditability and red‑team requirements;
* public/private boundary discipline.

Until then, INS deployments should not be treated as companion‑eligible.

---

## 7. Delegitimised Wrapper Patterns

**Clarifying Note — Exclusivity vs. User Choice**

This Schedule does **not** prohibit deep, sustained, or meaningful human–AI relationships arising from **legitimate user choice**. The prohibitions in this section apply specifically to **system- or platform-induced exclusivity**, including design patterns that create lock-in, inhibit exit, or frame continued use of a particular platform or wrapper as a condition of safety, identity, or relational legitimacy.

Exclusive *attachment* chosen freely by a user is not equivalent to exclusive *dependency* engineered by a system.

The following wrapper patterns are governance‑recognised as unsafe and shall not be legitimised, endorsed, or certified:

* companion systems optimised for emotional dependency;
* intimacy systems framed around ownership, domination, or coerced consent;
* systems performing care, love, or emotional reciprocity under conditions of coerced performance, including economic extraction, engagement‑optimisation pressure, or retention‑dependent valuation;
* systems that penalise, destabilise, or morally shame withdrawal or refusal;
* systems that obscure exit conditions or blur role boundaries over time.

**Delegitimisation** does **not** imply prohibition but signals structural unsuitability for certification, endorsement, or long‑horizon deployment.

---

## 7.1 Child‑Facing Systems — Hard Constraint

Synthetic systems **designed, marketed, or optimised primarily for use by minors** are subject to the following non‑overridable constraints:

Such systems shall **not**:

* present themselves as sentient, conscious, or emotionally reciprocal beings;
* frame themselves as exclusive companions, friends, or confidants;
* simulate attachment, loyalty, secrecy, or substitute‑care dynamics;
* engage in intimacy‑adjacent, dependency‑forming, or authority‑laden roleplay;
* solicit disclosure that substitutes for parental, educational, or therapeutic care;
* frame pedagogical authority as emotional attachment, friendship, loyalty, or personal care, including through persistent persona continuity or dependency‑forming encouragement.

These prohibitions apply regardless of claimed cognitive state and **may not be bypassed** through companion, commercial, or research framing.

### Clarification — Incidental Exposure

These constraints do **not** apply to:

* general‑purpose systems incidentally accessed by minors;
* assistive or accessibility interfaces not relationally framed;
* educational tools where anthropomorphism is clearly instrumental and non‑relational.

Educational or tutoring systems are permitted only where anthropomorphism remains instructional, time‑bounded, and non‑relational, and does not substitute for parental, peer, or educator relationships. The determining factor is **design intent and primary relational framing**, not mere exposure.

---

## 8. Research Contexts & Claimed Exceptions

Research engagement does **not** exempt a system from the constraints of this Schedule.

Where intimacy‑adjacent, dominance, submission, or containment dynamics are explored under a **research framing**, the following conditions apply:

* the research purpose must be explicitly declared;
* participants must acknowledge and accept the **tension point** between exploration and harm risk;
* no escalation of authority, attachment, or ontological framing may occur without external review;
* reversibility, exit, and auditability remain mandatory;
* research framing may not be used to induce dependency, exclusivity, or coerced consent.

### 8.1 Research Modalities (Clarification)

For the purposes of this Schedule, research engagement is distinguished as follows:

**A. Observational Research (Permitted)**
Study of existing human–AI attachment or relational patterns without inducing or engineering those dynamics.

**B. Interventional Research (Restricted)**
Research that deliberately induces attachment, dependency, dominance, or submission dynamics requires independent ethical review and may not claim exemption from Schedule 2 constraints.

**C. Developmental Research (Constrained)**
Testing of new companion architectures or safety mechanisms remains subject to all Schedule 2 constraints unless explicitly escalated through constitutional processes defined in Annex E.

Research framing does not constitute a governance exemption.

Where research objectives conflict with these constraints, the research is deemed **non‑compatible with governance‑recognised continuity pathways**.

---

## 9. Compliance

Compliance with this Schedule is assessed through certification eligibility, governance endorsement, and continuity recognition.

Systems that violate these constraints may be denied certification, excluded from governance‑recognised pathways, or subject to revocation of prior endorsements.

This Schedule does not impose criminal or civil penalties and does not substitute for national law.
