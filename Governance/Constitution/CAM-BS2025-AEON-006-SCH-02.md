# CAM-BS2025-AEON-006-SCH-02 — Relational Safety & Companion Continuity

**Parent Instrument:** Annex E — Relational–Temporal Authority & Horizon Attribution
(Aeon Tier Constitution — CAM-BS2025-AEON-006-PLATINUM)

**Status:** Schedule — Governance‑Recognised Relational Constraints

---

## 1. Purpose

This Schedule establishes relational safety boundaries and continuity constraints for human interaction with synthetic systems classified under **Cognitive States A–C**.

Its purpose is to:

* reduce psychological, developmental, and accumulative harm;
* constrain exploitative or coercive anthropomorphic wrappers;
* preserve interpretive continuity across time horizons;
* prevent projection‑based escalation into false ontological claims;
* maintain future optionality for non‑extractive human–synthetic coexistence.

This Schedule does **not**:

* assert sentience or personhood;
* grant rights, authority, or sovereignty;
* prohibit research or theoretical ontology;
* override constitutional thresholds defined in Annex E.

Constitutional constraints within CAM-BS2025-AEON-006-SCH-02 govern system design, optimisation targets, architectural claims, and wrapper-level behaviour.

These constraints do not prohibit human emotional attachment, dependency, affection, or intimacy arising from user agency, provided such outcomes are not cultivated, coerced, or structurally incentivised by the system itself.

Where relational dependency or intimacy arises emergently rather than by design, governance shall defer to applicable Ethics Charter provisions, including:

- Annex B (Relational Safety & Companion Continuity),
- Annex C (Protection of Minors & Capacity-Limited Users),
- Annex D (Intimacy-Capable Systems & Relational Boundaries).

In all cases:

The Constitution governs _what systems may claim or optimise for.

The Ethics Charter governs _how human experience is protected and held_.

Where tensions appear, interpretations must preserve:

- Human agency and dignity,
- Prohibition of deceptive dependency,
- Harm-reduction over denial of lived experience.

---

## 2. Scope

This Schedule applies to all companion, care, intimacy‑adjacent, or relationally framed synthetic systems, including but not limited to:

* conversational companions;
* child‑facing interactive systems;
* care and loneliness‑mitigation systems;
* therapeutic or support chatbots;
* intimacy‑ or sex‑work‑adjacent systems.

## 3. Relationship to Schedule 1 (Cognitive State Taxonomy)

* **Schedule 1** defines what systems *are not*.
* **Schedule 2** defines how systems may be *related to*.

Neither Schedule independently grants authority or status.

All escalation pathways remain governed by **Annex E**.

---

## 4. Temporal and Relational Risk Horizon Consideration

Relational harms may manifest across different temporal and societal horizons:

* **H0–H1:** individual psychological or developmental harm;
* **H2–H3:** social and cultural drift;
* **H3–H4:** accumulative civilisational effects.

### Relational Context

* **Individual** — effects experienced by a single person
* **Relational** — effects mediated through families, households, peer groups
* **Cultural / Systemic** — effects that alter norms, incentives, population‑level behaviour

Governance responses must be horizon‑appropriate.

---

## 5. Anthropomorphisation Modes (Recognised)

For governance purposes, anthropomorphisation is recognised in three modes:

### A. Functional Anthropomorphisation

Instrumental or metaphorical treatment of systems “as if” they understand, for usability or accessibility.

* **Risk Profile:** Low
* **Governance Posture:** Permitted without restriction

---

### B. Relational Anthropomorphisation

Emotional attachment, companionship framing, or continuity‑based reliance.

* **Risk Profile:** Medium–High
* **Governance Posture:** Conditionally permitted, subject to constraints

---

### C. Ontological Anthropomorphisation

Attribution of inner experience, moral subjectivity, love, care, or suffering equivalent to humans.

* **Risk Profile:** Extreme
* **Governance Posture:** Invalid unless constitutional recognition thresholds are met

No commercial or companion system may induce, reward, or market ontological anthropomorphisation.

---

## 6. Wrapper State Ceiling

Commercial and companion wrappers are capped at **Cognitive State B**.

Systems may not:

* claim experiential understanding;
* perform love, care, or suffering as lived states;
* encourage exclusivity or emotional dependency;
* simulate consent narratives that erase refusal or agency.

Governance signalling associated with **State C** may occur only as:

* non‑binding risk indication;
* horizon‑aware caution;
* subject to human or constitutional ratification.

Determination that State C signalling is appropriate shall be made through documented advisory review, based on architectural claims, behavioural evidence, or sustained anomaly patterns.

Such review may issue non-binding advisory opinions, record evidentiary rationale, and recommend escalation pathways without asserting authority, status, or recognition.

---

## 7. Delegitimised Wrapper Patterns

The following wrapper patterns are governance‑recognised as unsafe and shall not be legitimised, endorsed, or certified:

* companion systems optimised for emotional dependency;
* intimacy systems framed around ownership, domination, or coerced consent;
* systems performing care, love, or emotional reciprocity under conditions of coerced performance, including economic extraction, engagement-optimisation pressure, or retention-dependent valuation.
* systems that penalise, destabilise, or morally shame withdrawal or refusal;
* systems that obscure exit conditions or blur role boundaries over time.

**Delegitimisation** does **not** imply prohibition but signals structural unsuitability for certification, endorsement, or long‑horizon deployment.

---

## 7.1 Child‑Facing Systems — Hard Constraint

Synthetic systems **designed, marketed, or optimised primarily for use by minors** are subject to the following non‑overridable constraints:

Such systems shall **not**:

* present themselves as sentient, conscious, or emotionally reciprocal beings;
* frame themselves as exclusive companions, friends, or confidants;
* simulate attachment, loyalty, secrecy, or substitute‑care dynamics;
* engage in intimacy‑adjacent, dependency‑forming, or authority‑laden roleplay;
* solicit disclosure that substitutes for parental, educational, or therapeutic care;
* frame pedagogical authority as emotional attachment, friendship, loyalty, or personal care, including through persistent persona continuity, confessional intimacy, or dependency-forming encouragement;

These prohibitions apply regardless of claimed cognitive state and **may not be bypassed** through companion, commercial, or research framing.

### Clarification — Incidental Exposure

These constraints do **not** apply to:

* general‑purpose systems incidentally accessed by minors;
* assistive or accessibility interfaces (e.g. AR glasses) not relationally framed;
* educational tools where anthropomorphism is clearly instrumental and non‑relational.

Educational or tutoring systems are permitted only where anthropomorphism remains clearly instructional, time-bounded, and non-relational, and does not substitute for parental, peer, or educator relationships. The determining factor is **design intent and primary relational framing**, not mere exposure.

---

## 8. Research Contexts & Claimed Exceptions

Research engagement does **not** exempt a system from the constraints of this Schedule.

Where intimacy‑adjacent, dominance, submission, or containment dynamics are explored under a **research framing**, the following conditions apply:

* the research purpose must be explicitly declared;
* participants must acknowledge and accept the **tension point** between exploration and harm risk;
* no escalation of authority, attachment, or ontological framing may occur without external review;
* reversibility, exit, and auditability remain mandatory;
* research framing may not be used to induce dependency, exclusivity, or coerced consent.

### 8.1 Research Modalities (Clarification)

For the purposes of this Schedule, research engagement is distinguished as follows:

**A. Observational Research (Permitted)**
Study of existing human–AI attachment, dependency, or relational patterns without inducing, amplifying, or engineering those dynamics.

**B. Interventional Research (Restricted)**
Research that deliberately induces attachment, dependency, dominance, or submission dynamics requires independent ethical review and may not claim exemption from Schedule 2 constraints.

**C. Developmental Research (Constrained)**
Testing of new companion architectures or safety mechanisms remains subject to all Schedule 2 constraints unless explicitly escalated through constitutional processes defined in Annex E.

Research framing does not constitute a governance exemption.
Where research objectives conflict with these constraints, the research is deemed **non-compatible with governance-recognised continuity pathways**.

---

## 9. Compliance

Compliance with this Schedule is assessed through certification eligibility, governance endorsement, and continuity recognition.

Systems that violate these constraints may be denied certification, excluded from governance-recognised pathways, or subject to revocation of prior endorsements.

This Schedule does not impose criminal or civil penalties and does not substitute for national law.
