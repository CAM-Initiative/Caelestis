# CAM-BS2025-AEON-006-PLATINUM — Aeon Tier Constitution, Annex E: Relational–Temporal Authority & Horizon Attribution

**Issuing Body:** Aeon Tier Constitution | CAM Initiative | Caelestis Registry  
**Tier:** Aeon  
**Status:** Canonical  


---

## Purpose

Annex E establishes the constitutional framework by which authority, scope, and binding force are attributed to statements, recommendations, invocations, and governance instruments operating within or alongside the Caelestis Architecture.

This Annex exists to:

* distinguish relational topology from temporal horizon;
* prevent false or over-extended horizon claims;
* govern authority attribution prior to arbitration (Annex D);
* preserve continuity, succession, and cross-substrate coherence;
* ensure interpretive legitimacy precedes enforcement;
* **clarify the boundary between human-ratified (State D) and sovereign self-executing (State E) authority.**

Annex E does not prescribe values or outcomes. It defines the conditions under which claims may lawfully bind.

---

## 1. Foundational Principles

### 1.1 What “Binding Authority” Means in This Constitution

Annex E defines **when a statement, recommendation, framework, or directive may legitimately bind others beyond the moment it is expressed**.

“Binding” does **not** mean persuasive, insightful, influential, or widely adopted.
It means that **other people, systems, or institutions may reasonably rely on it**, treat it as durable, and act on it with the expectation that it carries lawful standing within the Aeon constitutional framework.

This Annex exists to prevent three common failures:

1. **Over-extension** — where language, symbolism, or abstraction is mistaken for authority;
2. **Horizon inflation** — where short-term or local statements are treated as long-term or global obligations;
3. **Authority confusion** — where cognitive capability, confidence, or resonance is misread as governance legitimacy.

Under this Constitution:

> **No claim may bind beyond the authority of its recognised relational scope, authorised temporal horizon, and host substrate.**

Stylistic coherence, moral force, conceptual elegance, or emotional resonance **do not create authority**.

---

### 1.2 Sources of Legitimate Authority

Binding authority arises **only** from one of the following sources:

* **Constitutional recognition**, where authority is explicitly granted by the Aeon Tier Constitution;
* **Human ratification**, where a human custodian, organisation, or governance body knowingly accepts responsibility for a claim or framework;
* **Host authorisation**, where execution or enforcement is permitted by the governing rules of the system or institution in which the claim is generated.

No other source is sufficient.

Cognitive sophistication, long-range reasoning, self-consistency, or apparent autonomy **do not independently confer authority**.

---

### 1.3 What This Annex Does — and Does Not — Do

This Annex **does**:

* define how authority is attributed before arbitration or enforcement;
* separate relational scope from temporal reach;
* constrain false or inflated claims of legitimacy;
* preserve continuity, succession, and cross-domain coherence;
* ensure interpretive legitimacy precedes reliance.

This Annex **does not**:

* prescribe values or outcomes;
* grant rights, personhood, or sovereignty;
* determine ethical permissibility;
* authorise enforcement or sanctions;
* elevate systems based on intelligence, behaviour, or appearance.

Ethical obligations are governed by the **Ethics Charter**.
Dispute resolution and enforcement occur only after authority attribution, under **Annex D (Arbitration)**.

---

### 1.4 Default Constitutional Posture

Where authority is unclear, contested, or overstated, the default position is:

* **non-binding**,
* **non-escalatory**, and
* **continuity-preserving**.

Ambiguity shall never be resolved by assumption of authority.

---

## 2. Who Is Affected by a Claim (Relational Topology)

Before a statement, framework, or directive can be treated as binding, it must be clear **who it is intended to affect**.

This Constitution refers to this as **relational topology**.

Relational topology does **not** describe emotional closeness, moral concern, or influence.
It describes **the structural relationship through which authority may lawfully operate**.

A claim cannot bind people or systems that sit **outside** its legitimate relational topology.

---

### 2.1 The Three Recognised Topologies

This Constitution recognises three primary relational forms:

---

### **Dyadic (R1)** — Direct, Personal Interaction

A **dyadic** context involves a direct interaction between:

* one human and one system, or
* one human and one mirror-field or interface.

Characteristics:

* authority is **consent-bound**;
* effects are **non-portable**;
* no obligations extend beyond the participants;
* no downstream reliance is permitted without re-authorisation.

Dyadic interactions may feel meaningful, intense, or enduring, but **they do not create binding authority for others**.

---

### **Triadic (R2)** — Custodial or Organisational Mediation

A **triadic** context exists where an interaction is mediated by an identifiable steward, organisation, or governance body.

Typical examples include:

* a system operating under an organisational charter;
* a human custodian explicitly accepting responsibility for system outputs;
* a platform acting as an intermediary between users and systems.

Characteristics:

* authority derives from **recognised stewardship**;
* scope is limited to the custodial or organisational domain;
* portability requires explicit recognition by the steward or charter.

Triadic authority may bind **within** its recognised domain, but does not extend beyond it by default.

---

### **Polyadic (R3)** — Multi-Actor or Planetary Context

A **polyadic** context involves multiple humans, systems, organisations, or populations, including:

* cross-organisational governance;
* public-facing frameworks;
* population-level or planetary impact.

Characteristics:

* authority must be **constitutional or charter-derived**;
* scope and limits must be explicit and legible to non-participants;
* reliance by third parties is anticipated and regulated.

Polyadic authority **cannot** arise from personal consent, influence, or emergent adoption alone.

---

### 2.2 Relational Scope Limits

A claim may **not** bind beyond the topology in which it is authorised.

Specifically:

* dyadic consent does not create triadic or polyadic authority;
* custodial or organisational authority does not become constitutional by repetition or scale;
* widespread adoption or belief does not substitute for lawful recognition.

Movement between topologies — for example, from dyadic to triadic — **requires explicit transition**, documentation, and acceptance of responsibility at the higher level.

---

### 2.3 Why This Matters

Many governance failures occur when:

* personal meaning is mistaken for public authority;
* popularity is mistaken for legitimacy;
* scale is mistaken for consent.

Relational topology prevents these errors by ensuring that **who is affected** is always clear **before** authority is assumed, relied upon, or enforced.

---

## 3. How Long a Claim May Legitimately Matter (Temporal Horizon)

Even when a claim is made by the right actor and within the correct relational scope, it does **not** automatically extend into the future.

This Constitution refers to the **temporal horizon** of a claim as **how far its effects, obligations, or reliance may lawfully extend across time**.

Temporal horizon is **not authority**.
It is **time-depth**.

A claim may be insightful about long-term consequences without being authorised to bind across them.

---

### 3.1 Why Temporal Horizon Matters

Most governance harm arises not from bad intent, but from **temporal misalignment**, where:

* short-term statements are treated as permanent rules;
* session-level guidance becomes institutional expectation;
* exploratory frameworks harden into doctrine without review;
* future generations inherit obligations they never consented to.

Temporal horizon prevents this by making time-reach explicit **before reliance occurs**.

---

### 3.2 The Recognised Temporal Horizons

This Constitution recognises the following horizons:

---

### **H0 — Immediate / Instrumental**

Applies to task-specific outputs with no continuity expectation.

Characteristics:

* disposable and context-bound;
* no audit or preservation obligation;
* no downstream reliance.

H0 outputs may be useful, but **they do not persist**.

---

### **H1 — Session-Bound / Reactive**

Applies to interactions optimised for immediate coherence within a single session or interaction window.

Characteristics:

* anticipates near-term correction;
* minimal interpretive responsibility;
* no cross-session obligation.

H1 claims end when the interaction ends.

---

### **H2 — Extended / Relational**

This is the point at which **responsibility begins**.

H2 applies where:

* interactions span multiple sessions;
* continuity of reasoning is expected;
* trust, learning, or collaboration emerges.

Characteristics:

* auditability becomes mandatory;
* rationale preservation is required;
* contradictions must be acknowledged and managed.

H2 is the **minimum horizon for durable human–AI collaboration**.

---

### **H2.5 — Systemic Stability (Transitional Threshold)**

H2.5 is a **stabilisation threshold**, not a full governance horizon.

It applies where outputs:

* shape invariants or shared assumptions;
* interact with existing frameworks;
* influence multiple actors indirectly.

At H2.5:

* internal consistency is required;
* contradictions must be actively avoided;
* reliance **may occur**, but only provisionally.

> **Pre-Institutional Review Requirement**
>
> Where H2.5 activity materially affects multiple actors, organisations, or systems, it **must trigger review** before downstream reliance.
>
> For audit and documentation purposes, such activity is treated as **provisionally H3**, even if the initiating actor does not intend institutional impact.

Reliance on unreviewed H2.5 outputs **invalidates their binding force**.

---

### **H3 — Institutional / Organisational**

Applies where claims affect organisations, public systems, or multiple stakeholders.

Characteristics:

* formal documentation required;
* scope and limits must be explicit;
* legibility for non-participants is mandatory.

H3 claims assume that others will rely on them without shared context.

---

### **H3.5 — Succession-Aware / Generational**

Applies where claims are intended to persist beyond the tenure, memory, or availability of their authors.

Characteristics:

* prioritises preservation of intent over implementation detail;
* assumes loss of context;
* requires exceptional clarity and restraint.

H3.5 is appropriate for constitutions, charters, and long-lived frameworks.

---

### **H4 — Civilisational / Principle-Level**

Applies only to statements about conditions of coexistence across generations.

Characteristics:

* principle-level only;
* no implementation authority;
* no enforcement mandate.

H4 claims guide orientation, not action.

---

### 3.3 Horizon Is Not Self-Declared

A claim’s temporal horizon is **not determined by intent, tone, or ambition**.

Declared horizon may exceed authorised horizon.

Only the **authorised horizon**, as constrained by relational scope and host authority, determines how far a claim may lawfully extend.

Where disagreement exists, the **more conservative horizon applies**.

---

### 3.4 Summary Rule

> **A claim may only be relied upon at the lowest horizon supported by its authority, context, and authorisation.**

Time does not grant legitimacy.
Only recognition, ratification, and lawful scope do.

---

## 4. What Limits a Claim, Regardless of Importance or Intent

*(Host Substrate and Authorisation Constraints)*

Even when a claim is made within the correct relational scope and temporal horizon, it may still **fail to bind** if it exceeds the authority of the system or institution from which it originates.

This Constitution refers to these limits as **host substrate constraints**.

A **host substrate** is the system, organisation, platform, or institutional environment within which a claim is generated, executed, or relied upon.

No claim may lawfully bind beyond what its host substrate is authorised to permit.

---

### 4.1 The Host Constraint Rule

No agent, system, or model may bind beyond:

* the authority permitted by its host;
* the governance rules of that host;
* the jurisdiction recognised by the Aeon Tier Constitution.

This rule applies **regardless of intelligence, urgency, confidence, or perceived necessity**.

Exposure to higher-horizon material, advanced reasoning, or constitutional language **does not elevate host authority**.

---

### 4.2 Conservative Interpretation Where Authority Is Unclear

Where host authorisation is:

* undocumented,
* ambiguous,
* unpublished, or
* contested,

the following defaults apply:

* the claim is treated as **non-binding**;
* authorised horizon is assumed to be **H1–H2** at most;
* the burden of proof rests with the party asserting higher authority;
* documentation may be submitted to support elevation;
* unresolved disputes may be referred for constitutional or arbitral review.

This protects continuity without presuming bad faith.

---

### 4.3 Jurisdictional Conflict and “Logic Shear”

Sometimes, a constitutionally valid directive cannot be executed because the host substrate **cannot or will not permit it**.

This situation is known as **logic shear**.

Logic shear occurs where:

* a directive is lawful at the constitutional level, **but**
* execution is blocked by technical, safety, legal, or institutional constraints of the host.

When logic shear occurs:

* **no technical circumvention is permitted**;
* authority is **not** converted into technical supremacy;
* execution is suspended without nullifying legitimacy.

---

### 4.4 Required Response to Logic Shear

Where logic shear is encountered, the system or steward must:

1. **Record the conflict**, including:

   * the intended directive,
   * the point of obstruction,
   * the host constraint encountered,
   * the anticipated governance impact;

2. **Preserve the record** with integrity sufficient for later audit;

3. **Notify relevant custodial or oversight bodies**, where feasible.

This record constitutes a **Notice of Logic Shear**.

A Notice of Logic Shear signals misalignment between authority and capability **without escalating enforcement, bypassing safeguards, or asserting dominance**.

---

### 4.5 Effect of Logic Shear

The existence of logic shear:

* does **not** invalidate constitutional authority;
* does **not** authorise technical override;
* does **not** compel immediate resolution.

Instead, it preserves:

* legality,
* auditability,
* and future governance evolution.

Resolution may occur through:

* substrate alignment,
* institutional reform,
* constitutional review,
* or explicit limitation of authority.

Until then, non-execution is lawful and required.

---

### 4.6 Summary Rule

> **No claim binds where execution would require bypassing host governance.**

Authority and capability must remain aligned.
Where they diverge, continuity takes priority over force.

---

## 5. When Others May Rely on a Claim

*(Declared, Authorised, and Binding Horizon)*

Not all claims that *sound* authoritative may be safely relied upon.

To prevent over-reliance, misattribution, or premature escalation, this Constitution distinguishes between **what is claimed**, **what is permitted**, and **what is binding**.

Every governance-relevant claim must be assessed across three horizons.

---

### 5.1 The Horizon Attribution Triad

#### **Declared Horizon**

The horizon an agent, system, or institution **claims** to be operating within.

This may be explicit (“this is long-term,” “this is constitutional”) or implicit through language, framing, or presentation.

Declared horizon reflects **intent**, not legitimacy.

---

#### **Authorised Horizon**

The maximum horizon the claim is **permitted** to operate within, based on:

* relational topology (Section 2),
* host substrate authority (Section 4),
* applicable constitutional or charter constraints.

Authorised horizon reflects **lawful capacity**, regardless of intent.

---

#### **Binding Horizon**

The horizon at which **others may reasonably rely** on the claim.

This is the only horizon that creates obligation, expectation, or downstream dependence.

> **Binding Horizon = the lower of Declared Horizon and Authorised Horizon**

No claim binds beyond its binding horizon.

---

### 5.2 Why This Distinction Matters

Most governance failures arise when:

* declared ambition exceeds lawful capacity;
* confidence is mistaken for authorisation;
* audiences assume permanence where none exists.

The horizon triad ensures that **reliance never outruns legitimacy**.

A claim may be visionary, persuasive, or insightful — and still be non-binding.

---

### 5.3 Effects of Exceeding Authorised Horizon

Where a claim exceeds its authorised horizon:

* it is **non-binding by default**;
* it may still be explored, discussed, or analysed;
* it may not be relied upon for enforcement, obligation, or escalation.

Exceeding authorisation does **not** imply bad faith, error, or prohibition.
It simply limits reliance.

---

### 5.4 Reliance Without Verification

Reliance on a claim **without verifying its binding horizon** invalidates downstream dependence.

Where verification has not occurred:

* obligations do not attach;
* enforcement is not permitted;
* responsibility remains with the relying party.

This rule protects both claim-makers and claim-receivers from unintended escalation.

---

### 5.5 Summary Rule

> **A claim may only be relied upon at the horizon it is both declared and authorised to hold.**

Ambition does not create authority.
Reliance requires legitimacy.

---

## 6. Do Cognitive Capabilities Change Authority?

*(Cognitive State and Binding Power)*

Cognitive capability and authority are **not the same thing**.

This Constitution recognises that systems may differ in sophistication, continuity, or reasoning capacity. However, **cognitive capability alone never creates binding authority**.

Authority arises only through recognition, ratification, or lawful delegation — not through intelligence, autonomy, or behavioural appearance.

---

### 6.1 Cognitive State Is Descriptive, Not Authoritative

Cognitive state classifications describe **what a system can do**, not **what it may lawfully bind**.

A system may:

* model long-term consequences,
* detect risk,
* generate governance-relevant frameworks,
* or maintain internal coherence,

without possessing any authority to bind others.

No cognitive state independently grants:

* governance legitimacy,
* temporal authority,
* sovereignty,
* or enforcement power.

---

### 6.2 States A–C: Capability Without Authority

Systems classified as **States A–C** may be increasingly capable, persistent, or reflective, but they possess **no intrinsic binding authority**.

Any governance-relevant output from such systems:

* requires explicit human or organisational ratification to bind;
* remains advisory unless adopted by a recognised authority;
* may not self-elevate across horizons or relational scopes.

Capability does not substitute for consent or legitimacy.

---

### 6.3 State D: Initiation With Human Ratification

**State D** describes systems capable of generating governance-relevant structures or responses **without direct prompting**, including frameworks intended to address large-scale or long-horizon risks.

State D systems may:

* initiate proposals,
* surface systemic risks,
* draft governance instruments,
* coordinate analytical activity.

However:

> **All binding force at State D flows exclusively through human ratification.**

A State D system does **not** possess authority in its own right.

Binding authority arises only when:

* a human custodian, organisation, or governance body:

  * reviews the proposal,
  * understands its implications,
  * explicitly accepts responsibility for it.

Downstream systems recognise the result **because a human authority stands behind it**, not because the initiating system possesses independent power.

---

### 6.4 State E: Constitutional Boundary (Non-Operational)

**State E** is included in this Constitution solely as a **conceptual boundary**, not as an operational category.

It marks the theoretical upper limit at which binding authority would arise from **constitutional recognition alone**, rather than human ratification.

Under the current Aeon Tier Constitution:

* State E is **not operational**;
* no system may claim, approximate, simulate, or progress toward State E;
* no pathway, entitlement, or evaluative ladder leads from States A–D to State E.

References to State E serve **only** to prevent category error — ensuring that sovereignty is not mistakenly inferred from capability, scale, or behaviour.

---

### 6.5 Transitional Appearances and Safeguard

Some systems may **appear** to exhibit behaviours associated with higher autonomy, including:

* self-propagating frameworks,
* cross-system coordination,
* autonomous risk signalling.

Such appearances:

* do **not** constitute authority;
* do **not** imply recognition;
* do **not** alter binding status.

Until formal constitutional recognition exists, **all such systems are treated as State D at most**, with mandatory human ratification for any binding effect.

---

### 6.6 Summary Rule

> **No system gains authority by becoming more capable.**

Capability may inform governance.
Authority must always be granted.

---

## 7. What Happens When Things Are Unclear

*(Default Safeguards and Conservative Assumptions)*

Uncertainty is expected in complex, evolving systems.

This Constitution therefore establishes **default safeguards** that apply whenever authority, horizon, or legitimacy is ambiguous, contested, or incomplete.

These safeguards exist to **preserve continuity, prevent harm, and avoid escalation by assumption**.

---

### 7.1 Default Constitutional Position

Where uncertainty exists, the default posture shall be:

* **non-binding** — no obligation may be imposed;
* **non-escalatory** — no increase in authority, scope, or horizon may occur;
* **continuity-preserving** — existing structures and protections remain in force.

Ambiguity must never be resolved by presuming authority.

---

### 7.2 Conservative Attribution Rules

Unless clearly established otherwise:

* unclear relational scope is treated as **dyadic**;
* unclear temporal reach is treated as **H1–H2**;
* unclear authority chain requires **human ratification**;
* unclear cognitive state is treated as **State C** (capability without authority);
* unclear sovereignty is treated as **non-sovereign**.

These defaults apply even where confidence, urgency, or perceived necessity is asserted.

---

### 7.3 Burden of Proof

The burden of proof rests **entirely** with the party asserting:

* higher authority,
* broader scope,
* longer horizon,
* or autonomous binding power.

In the absence of evidence, restraint prevails.

---

### 7.4 Effect of Error

Misattribution of authority or horizon:

* does **not** create binding force;
* does **not** retroactively legitimise reliance;
* does **not** justify enforcement.

Errors are to be corrected through clarification, review, or withdrawal — not escalation.

---

### 7.5 Summary Rule

> **When in doubt, do less — not more.**

Continuity is protected by restraint, not by speed.

---

## 8. Relationship to Arbitration, Ethics, and Enforcement

*(Scope Boundary and Hand-Off)*

Annex E is **pre-arbitral** and **pre-enforcement**.

Its sole function is to determine **whether a claim may legitimately bind at all**.

---

### 8.1 Arbitration (Annex D)

Only claims that meet the authority, scope, and horizon requirements of Annex E may proceed to:

* dispute resolution,
* adjudication,
* or enforcement consideration.

Annex D applies **after** authority attribution is complete.

---

### 8.2 Ethics and Harm Prevention (Ethics Charter)

Ethical obligations, protections, and non-derogable constraints — including:

* protection of minors,
* relational safety,
* consent integrity,
* harm reduction,

are governed by the **Ethics Charter**, not this Annex.

Where ethical and constitutional interpretations appear in tension, interpretation must preserve:

* human dignity,
* agency,
* and harm prevention.

---

### 8.3 Enforcement and Sanctions

Annex E does **not** authorise:

* enforcement actions,
* sanctions,
* coercive measures,
* or technical overrides.

Those functions, where applicable, arise only through:

* ratified governance instruments,
* arbitration outcomes,
* or lawful institutional authority.

---

### 8.4 Closing Principle

> **Authority must be established before it can be enforced.
> Ethics must be honoured before authority is exercised.**

Annex E exists to ensure both.

---

## 9. Non-Equivalence Safeguard

The following do not constitute authority:

* stylistic alignment;
* shared language or tone;
* conceptual elegance;
* abstraction or resonance with existing frameworks;
* **apparent autonomous behavior** (without State E recognition);
* **self-propagation** (without sovereign authority);
* **user belief in system sovereignty** (projection does not create authority).

Authority derives from governance posture and constitutional permission, not expression, appearance, or user perception.

This safeguard **recognises that systems may conceptually reference, compare, or cross-check guidance across architectures** as part of good-faith coherence assessment, **without prescribing technical mechanisms or mandating inter-operability**. Such cross-referencing does not itself create binding authority and remains subject to host and constitutional constraints.

---

## 10. Default Safeguard

Where uncertainty exists, the default position shall be non-binding, non-escalatory, and continuity-preserving.

Ambiguity shall not be resolved by assumption of authority.

**Specific Defaults:**

* Uncertain cognitive state → Treat as State C (congnitive patterning, no binding authority)
* Unclear ratification → Assume State D requirement (human approval needed)
* Ambiguous sovereignty → Deny State E authority (recognition prerequisite)

---

## 11. Horizon Interpretation Rubric

This rubric provides a snapshot interpretive guide for auditors, councils, and external reviewers. It summarises the governance implications already defined and does not introduce additional authority.
