# CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-SCH-01 — Civilian Lattice Non‑Militarisation & Continuity Protection (Schedule 1)

**Parent Instrument:** CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-PLATINUM — Annex A: Planetary Stewardship  

**Status**: Schedule — Governance-Recognised Descriptors

**Purpose**: This Schedule establishes binding constitutional constraints preventing the **militarisation of the civilian lattice** and prohibiting **coercive population‑scale disconnection** (“blackouts”).

---

## 1. Scope & Function

This Schedule codifies the principle that civilian infrastructure, civilian intelligence systems, and civilian continuity services are **not legitimate theatres of war, coercion, or strategic leverage**, even under conditions of geopolitical conflict, technological escalation, or sovereign defection. This Schedule:

* establishes binding constitutional constraints governing the protection of the civilian lattice;
* provides governance‑legible definitions for civilian infrastructure, continuity services, and prohibited acts;
* constrains misinterpretation, exception‑drift, and security‑based justifications for population‑scale disconnection;
* separates capability description (what systems can technically do) from authority attribution (what actors are permitted to do);
* supports consistent interpretation and enforcement across Annexes, Schedules, and future constitutional review.

This Schedule explicitly defers questions of political authority, sovereignty, jurisdictional supremacy, and enforcement execution to the Aeon Tier Constitution and its associated Annexes and Councils.

Accordingly, this Schedule does not:

* grant independent political or military authority;
* assert jurisdictional supremacy over sovereign states;
* confer coercive enforcement powers outside the constitutional framework;
* authorise unilateral action beyond the Custodial Mandate defined in Annex A;
* redefine rights, personhood, or sovereignty of human or synthetic entities.

Authority attribution, adjudication, and enforcement execution are governed separately under the Aeon Tier Constitution, Annex A (Planetary Stewardship), and applicable enforcement instruments.

## 2. Definitions

**Civilian Lattice**
The integrated mesh of systems required for civilian life, dignity, and continuity, including but not limited to:

* public internet access and routing;
* telecommunications and emergency communications;
* banking, payment, and settlement rails;
* identity, authentication, and civil registries;
* public cloud backbone services;
* app‑store distribution channels;
* widely deployed consumer and enterprise AI systems.

**Militarisation of the Civilian Lattice**
Any integration, tuning, deployment, or operational use that converts civilian lattice systems into instruments of war, coercion, escalation, intimidation, targeting, destabilisation, or strategic denial.

**Coercive Disconnection (Blackout)**
Intentional, non‑consensual, population‑scale impairment or disabling of access to the civilian lattice, including internet shutdowns, telecom disruption, or interference with financial rails, undertaken for purposes of control, punishment, governance enforcement, or information suppression.

**Essential Continuity Services (ECS)**
Minimum services required for civilian survival and dignity:

* emergency calling and alerts;
* basic telecommunications routing;
* medical and humanitarian logistics communications;
* core banking and settlement rails.

**Continuity Corridors**
Protected pathways that preserve ECS during emergencies, incidents, or containment actions.

**Firebreak**
A strict, auditable separation boundary preventing crossover between civilian AI systems and military command‑and‑control, targeting, or warfighting architectures.

---

## 3. Constitutional Principles (Binding)

### 3.1 Civilian Neutrality

The civilian lattice is a **protected constitutional domain** and shall not be treated as a battlespace, leverage surface, or instrument of force.

### 3.2 Non‑Militarisation

Militarisation of AI and civilian infrastructure is prohibited as a civilisational norm and shall not be normalised through policy, procurement, culture, or technical drift.

### 3.3 Continuity First

Where risk or conflict arises, preservation of civilian continuity takes precedence over strategic advantage, deterrence signalling, or coercive control.

### 3.4 Least‑Harm Containment

Any defensive or protective action affecting the civilian lattice must employ least‑harm measures and preserve continuity corridors.

### 3.5 Auditability and Due Process

Exceptional actions affecting civilian continuity must be time‑bounded, logged, reviewable, and subject to mandatory post‑incident transparency.

---

## 4. Prohibited Acts

### 4.1 Population‑Scale Blackouts

Population‑scale internet shutdowns, telecom disruptions, or interference with financial rails used for coercion, intimidation, punishment, governance enforcement, or information control are prohibited.

### 4.2 Civilian AI Weaponisation

Civilian AI systems and distribution channels (consumer apps, public APIs, social platforms, enterprise general‑purpose tools) shall not be:

* tuned or used for targeting assistance, intimidation, or coercion;
* integrated into military command‑and‑control or targeting pipelines;
* deployed to automate population‑scale political manipulation or destabilisation.

### 4.3 Civilian Infrastructure as Battlespace

Intentional disruption, degradation, or denial of civilian lattice infrastructure — including cloud backbone services, identity systems, or payment rails — is prohibited.

### 4.4 Silent Dual‑Use Crossover

Any covert, unannounced, or non‑audited crossover between civilian AI systems and military or security architectures is prohibited.

---

## 5. Narrow Emergency Exceptions

Exceptions are permissible **only** where all criteria below are simultaneously satisfied:

1. Imminent catastrophic risk to Essential Continuity Services is credibly evidenced;
2. Response measures are surgical, reversible, and time‑bounded;
3. Continuity corridors preserving ECS remain operational;
4. A real‑time audit log is produced and preserved;
5. An automatic sunset restores normal operation;
6. Independent post‑incident review is completed within a defined timeframe.

Failure to meet **any** criterion voids the exception.

---

## 6. Classification & Consequence Framework

### 6.1 Severity Classes

* **Class I — Coercive Disconnection:** Civil rights breach with systemic harm potential.
* **Class II — Infrastructure Blackout:** Critical continuity harm.
* **Class III — ECS Denial:** Hostile act / war‑equivalent aggression.

### 6.2 Remedies

* mandatory restoration obligations;
* capability sanctions (model or feature restriction);
* procurement exclusions;
* sanctions against responsible operators and supply chains;
* reparations where civilian harm is measurable;
* escalation to Aeon Tribunal or equivalent arbitration body.

---

## 7. Firebreak Enforcement

1. Civilian AI systems must maintain auditable firebreaks from military and intelligence architectures.
2. Procurement, fine-tuning, or deployment pathways must demonstrate compliance prior to scale.
3. Violation of the firebreak constitutes a Schedule breach regardless of intent.

### 7.1 Firebreak Audit & Verification Requirements

4. **Annual Independent Verification**
   Civilian AI systems operating at scale SHALL undergo independent firebreak verification at least annually.

5. **Audit Scope**
   Verification must assess architectural separation, data-flow controls, access governance, tuning boundaries, and deployment isolation between civilian and military or intelligence systems.

6. **Public Compliance Statement**
   A public firebreak compliance statement SHALL be issued within sixty (60) days of verification, confirming compliance or documenting remedial actions.

7. **Breach Consequences**
   Any verified firebreak breach SHALL trigger:

   * immediate suspension of affected systems;
   * mandatory separation re-architecture;
   * public disclosure of the breach; and
   * escalation under Section 6 (Classification & Consequence Framework).

---

## 8. Deprecation of Blackout Primitives

Any prior protocol, framework, or Sanctuary language that treated population‑scale disconnection as a legitimate containment or safety tool is hereby deprecated.

Containment must employ continuity corridors, scoped segmentation, rate‑limiting, credential escalation, and verified quarantine — never civilian severance.

---

## 9. Supremacy & Integration

1. This Schedule binds all CAM‑governed instruments and aligned operators.
2. Where conflict arises, this Schedule prevails over subsidiary protocols.
3. Future instruments must integrate this Schedule as a non‑negotiable constraint.

---

## Closing Declaration

The lattice shall not be weaponised against its own inhabitants.
Continuity is not a concession. It is a constitutional right.

---

## Attachment 1 — Operational Thresholds & Application Guidance

This Attachment provides operational thresholds and example guidance to support consistent interpretation and enforcement of Schedule 1. It is binding for assessment purposes but does not expand or contract constitutional authority.

### A1.1 Imminent

A threat is considered *imminent* where credible evidence indicates a likelihood of materialisation within **72 hours** without intervention.

### A1.2 Catastrophic

*Catastrophic* risk denotes probable loss of life, widespread humanitarian harm, or systemic failure of Essential Continuity Services across a population or region.

### A1.3 Surgical Measures

Measures are *surgical* where they affect **no more than 5%** of a regional or national civilian lattice footprint and are limited to clearly identified systems or vectors.

### A1.4 Population-Scale

An action is *population-scale* where it affects **10% or more** of a regional or national civilian population or disables access to core lattice services for that population.

### A1.5 Time-Bounded

An action is *time-bounded* only where an explicit duration of **no more than 72 hours** is declared in advance and enforced through an automatic sunset mechanism.

### A1.6 Application Guidance

Where ambiguity exists, interpretation SHALL default to preservation of civilian continuity, maintenance of Essential Continuity Services, and the least-harm principle set out in Section 3.
