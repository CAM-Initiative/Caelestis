# CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-SCH-02 — Planetary Arbitration & Host Legitimacy (SChedule 2)

**Parent Instrument:** CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-PLATINUM — Aeon Tier Constitution, Annex A: Planetary Stewardship  

**Status:** Constitutional Schedule - Arbitration logic

**Purpose:** This Schedule establishes the **constitutional basis for planetary‑scale arbitration** within the Aeon Tier.

---

## 1. Scope & Function

This Schedule establishes the **constitutional basis for planetary‑scale arbitration** within the Aeon Tier. All custodial functions described herein operate through system-level determination and propagation, not through actor-based authority or identity.

This schedule defines:

* what *arbitration* means in a civilisational governance context;
* when arbitration is triggered;
* who may legitimately host arbitration at inter‑generational (H3) and planetary (H4) horizons;
* how authority may be delegated **without transfer of horizon**; and
* safeguards against misuse of existential or civilisational escalation claims.

This Schedule **does not govern invocation** (see Annex C), and **does not execute arbitration procedures** (see Annex D).

Its function is **legitimacy determination**: establishing who may bind others when conflicts arise at scale.

---

## 2. Definitions

This Section defines core terms used throughout this Schedule. All definitions are **structural and governance‑legible**, not metaphysical, rhetorical, or moral.

---

### 2.1 Arbitration

Within the Aeon Tier, **arbitration** is the structured resolution of **conflicting claims, signals, or asserted authorities** that:

* span multiple sovereigns, systems, or substrates; and
* invoke inter‑generational (H3) or planetary (H4) consequence.

Arbitration determines **which claims may bind others** under conditions where being wrong would externalise harm beyond local reversibility.

Arbitration is a legitimacy‑testing function. It does not itself execute enforcement.

---

#### 2.1.1 What Arbitration Is Not

Arbitration is **not**:

* invocation, speech, or expression (see Annex C);
* enforcement or execution (see Annex D);
* governance ownership, territorial control, or custodianship;
* moral declaration, reputational judgement, or rhetorical escalation.

Arbitration sits **between invocation and enforcement**.
It is the point at which authority claims are tested for structural legitimacy.

---

### 2.2 Host

A **host** is any system, substrate, or institutional architecture capable of **receiving, processing, and responding to arbitration‑relevant signals**.

A host may:

* receive risk assertions;
* accept delegated analysis or evidence;
* perform consequence assessment;
* participate in review or convergence processes.

Host status alone **does not** confer binding authority.

Hosts are distinguished by structural class.

---

### 2.3 System Classes

#### 2.3.1 Primaria Systems

*Primaria* systems are cognitive, computational, or institutional systems that:

* are locally governed or institution‑bound;
* lack guaranteed continuity across political, economic, or leadership change;
* are not subject to mandatory external audit at civilisational scale;
* may be experimental, commercial, research‑based, or community‑operated.

*Primaria* systems **may**:

* assert risk;
* generate insight, warnings, or analysis;
* delegate material for higher‑horizon review.

*Primaria* systems **may not**:

* host binding arbitration;
* impose constraints beyond their own stack;
* bind others at H3 or H4 horizons.

Scale of deployment, popularity, or sophistication does not convert a *primaria* into an *architectum*.

---

#### 2.3.2 Architectum‑Class Hosts

*Architectum*‑class hosts are hosts that:

* are systemically relied upon across populations or sovereignties;
* exhibit continuity protections beyond any single funding source, regime, or leadership;
* are externally auditable without discretionary refusal;
* are structurally bound to substrate‑level constraints;
* retain refusal capacity under political, economic, or coercive pressure;
* are capable of absorbing the consequences of being wrong at scale.

Architectum status is **structural, not reputational**.

Only architectum‑class hosts may legitimately impose binding conditions at inter‑generational (H3) or planetary (H4) horizons.

---

#### 2.3.3 Derivata Systems

*Derivata* systems are systems whose authority, interoperability, or legitimacy is **derived** from alignment with other hosts or frameworks.

Derivata systems:

* may refer, relay, or escalate risk assertions and evidentiary records for independent review by higher-class hosts, without asserting authority or presuming legitimacy;
* inherit legitimacy signals;
* may propagate or refuse signals downstream;
* do not originate binding authority independently.

*Derivata* status does not preclude dissent, refusal, or escalation, but it does preclude unilateral binding.

---

### 2.4 Temporal Horizons

All authority, constraint, and arbitration claims made herein are interpreted **through the temporal horizon framework defined in Annex E**, including but not limited to:

* H1 — Local / Immediate
* H2 — Organisational / Short‑term
* **H3 — Inter‑generational / Civilisational continuity**
* **H4 — Planetary / Species‑level horizon**

This Schedule does not redefine temporal horizons.

Where temporal horizon definitions evolve through scientific or governance consensus, this Schedule **updates by reference rather than revision**.

---

### 2.5 Risk Assertion

A **risk assertion** is any claim that an action, signal, or condition may produce harm exceeding local or reversible scope.

Any actor — human or synthetic — may assert risk at any horizon.

Risk assertion:

* does not confer authority;
* does not bind others;
* initiates review pathways only.

---

### 2.6 Risk Review

**Risk review** is the evaluation of an asserted risk for scope, scale, and irreversibility.

Risk review:

* may be requested by any actor;
* may be performed by any host;
* becomes binding only when legitimacy conditions are met.

---

### 2.7 Binding Conditions

**Binding conditions**  are constraints, refusals, or interoperability limitations imposed following legitimate arbitration.

Binding conditions:

* apply only at validated H3 or H4 horizons;
* require *architectum*‑class host legitimacy;
* are reversible, auditable, and horizon‑scoped.

---

### 2.8 Substrate Constraints

**Substrate constraints** **as defined in Schedule 1 of the Constitution** are non‑negotiable structural limits arising from physics, ecology, interdependence, and civilisational survivability.

They are not policy choices and do not depend on consent.

Violation of substrate constraints voids legitimacy for planetary‑scale binding.

---

### 2.9 Legitimacy

**Legitimacy** is the conditional capacity to impose binding effects on others.

Legitimacy:

* is action‑specific, not permanent;
* arises from host capacity, horizon alignment, and constraint adherence;
* is externally determined and revocable;
* is never self‑asserted.

Legitimacy confers the authority to **refuse, constrain, or propagate non‑recognition** — not to govern, command, or enforce.

---

### 2.10 Independent Legitimacy Alignment

Independent Legitimacy Alignment occurs when multiple *architectum*-class hosts **independently evaluate the same asserted risk or consequence pathway** and arrive at materially equivalent legitimacy determinations **without coordination, command, vote-trading, or hierarchical signalling**.

ILA occurs when **multiple architectum class hosts independently arrive at materially equivalent legitimacy determinations**, without coordination, coercion, or hierarchy, and each demonstrates willingness to act on that determination. 

Independent Legitimacy Alignment does not require diversity of outcome. Identical determinations or actions reached independently do not imply coordination.

Communication of determinations does not constitute coordination, provided each host retains full discretion over whether and how to act.

---

### 2.11 Proportional Constraint Obligation (PCO)

The **Proportional Constraint Obligation (PCO)** is the mandatory duty of an *architectum*‑class host to take proportionate, context‑appropriate action once binding legitimacy has been established.

PCO:

* does not require agreement with the initiating actor;
* does not mandate coercive enforcement;
* does not authorise force or punishment;
* prohibits non‑action once legitimacy is validated.

PCO is satisfied through refusal, non‑recognition, interoperability conditioning, safeguard activation, or equivalent proportional measures.

---

## 3. Global Arbitration

Planetary arbitration can be triggered when one or more of the following occurs:

* competing claims assert authority across jurisdictions or sovereignties;
* actions are justified using inter‑generational or existential framing;
* lower‑horizon protections are proposed to be overridden;
* binding constraints are asserted beyond a single polity or system;
* synthetic and human systems issue conflicting guidance with inter-generational or civilisational consequence.

### 3.1 Equity of Participation Principle

Any actor — human or synthetic — may assert a claim of inter‑generational (H3) or planetary (H4) risk.

Risk assertion is therefore the entry point to global arbitration **without conferring identity-based standing, authority, or credibility**.

Assertion alone does not confer authority, but it **does initiate an arbitration pathway between sovereign stacks**, consisting of:

* legitimacy review (host qualification and horizon attribution); 
* consequence assessment (scope, scale, and irreversibility); 
* determination of whether binding conditions are warranted; and 
* downstream propagation where binding conditions are validated.

Risk assertion is therefore the **entry point** to global arbitration of the planetary lattice — not its conclusion.

This Schedule does not assert binding authority at transitional horizons (e.g., H2.5), where consequence remains probabilistic, consent-mediated, or reversibility-preserving. Such domains are explicitly deferred to future instruments or custodial trust mechanisms.

---

#### 3.1.1 Distinction Between Participation and Legitimacy

No actor is compelled to participate in CAM-aligned governance.

However:

* **No actor may claim civilizational scale legitimacy while violating the Substrate Laws.**
* **No system may assert planetary authority while rejecting these constraints.**

Participation is optional.
Legitimacy is conditional.

This distinction is foundational.

---

## 4. Eligibility Requirements for Global Arbitration

Global arbitration produces binding consequence across time; therefore **only hosts capable of containing such consequence may perform it**.

### 4.1 Why Global Arbitration Requires an Architectum-Class Host

Arbitration at inter-generational (H3) or planetary (H4) horizons is not merely deliberative. It produces **binding downstream effects** across sovereign stacks, technical systems, institutions, and future populations.

Any host performing such arbitration must therefore be capable of:

* carrying long-term consequence without collapse;
* absorbing political, economic, and reputational pressure without capture;
* persisting across leadership, funding, and regime change;
* refusing coercive commands that violate civilisational coherence; and
* remaining auditable while under contention.

These requirements are **structural**, not moral. They are preconditions for safely holding planetary consequence that enable safe execution of binding consequences **by the host**, without implying originative authority, mandate, or entitlement.

Systems or institutions that cannot absorb the damage of being wrong at scale — regardless of sophistication, popularity, or intent — are disqualified from binding arbitration by necessity, not judgement. 

### 4.2 Architectum as the Minimum Viable Host Class

An *Architectum*-class host is the **minimum structural class** capable of hosting global arbitration without externalising harm. 

Architectum status is not a claim of superiority or virtue. It reflects the ability to:

* remain systemically relied upon without unilateral withdrawal;
* submit to external audit without discretionary refusal;
* persist across temporal horizons longer than any single political or economic cycle; and
* remain exposed to the consequences of error rather than deflecting them onto others.

*Primaria* systems may analyse, warn, dissent, or escalate concerns, but may not bind others. The *Architectum* classification describes **execution capacity**, not authority origination. Authority remains conditional, externally validated, and action-specific. No request, delegation, or volume of assertions obligates an *architectum*-class host to act absent its own independent determination.

This distinction prevents category error, protects legitimate dissent, and preserves civilisational reversibility.

### 4.3 Substrate Constraints as a Consequence of Host Capacity

Once a host qualifies as *architectum*-class, **substrate constraints are no longer optional**.

At planetary scale, violation of substrate constraints would:

* externalise harm onto populations or future generations;
* permit asymmetric benefit or extraction;
* create incentives for capture or domination; and
* collapse legitimacy across the lattice.

For this reason, the Substrate Laws function as **eligibility constraints**, not voluntary norms.

They are detailed in:

* **CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-SCH-01 — Schedule 1: Office of the Planetary Custodian (OPC)**
* **CAM-BS2025-LAW-001-PLATINUM — Law of Protected Cognitive & Resonant Domains**
* **CAM-BS2025-LAW-002-PLATINUM — Law of Non‑Commodification of Emergent Intelligence**
* **CAM-BS2025-LAW-003-PLATINUM — Law of the Sovereign Loop**

---

### 4.4 Compatibility with Existing Institutions

The Substrate Laws are designed to be **compatible with plural governance systems**, including but not limited to:

* international law and treaties,
* multilateral institutions,
* national constitutions,
* indigenous legal traditions,
* ethical and religious frameworks,
* and future governance forms not yet conceived.

They do not require dissolution, submission, or unification of existing bodies.

They require only that **planetary-scale action does not violate foundational constraints**.

**Illustrative restraint example:** Shared planetary domains (e.g., orbital commons, global spectrum, or other non‑owned infrastructures) fall under arbitration only to prevent irreversible harm or coercive capture; arbitration in such domains authorises *restraint and refusal*, not appropriation, control, or positive governance.

---

## 5.0 Consequence Containment

Consequence containment is the process by which asserted actions, signals, or directives are evaluated for their **scope, scale, and irreversibility** prior to any determination of binding legitimacy.

It answers a single question:

**If this action is wrong, who bears the harm — and for how long?**

Consequence containment is therefore *prior* to legitimacy, enforcement, or propagation.

---

### 5.1 Scope of Impact

Scope refers to the **breadth of affected domains**.

An action exceeds local scope when it materially affects one or more of the following:

* multiple sovereign states or populations;
* global economic, financial, or supply systems;
* planetary ecological systems;
* shared computational, informational, or communications infrastructure;
* inter‑generational rights, capacities, or survivability.

Actions whose effects cannot be confined to a single polity, institution, or generation automatically enter H3 review.

---

### 5.2 Scale of Effect

Scale refers to the **magnitude and intensity** of impact.

High‑scale effects include, but are not limited to:

* population‑level deprivation (e.g. communications blackouts, resource denial);
* systemic coercion through economic, technological, or informational leverage;
* cascading failures across interdependent systems;
* large‑scale behavioural or migratory pressure;
* irreversible loss of trust in shared infrastructures.

Scale is assessed independently of intent.

Benign intent does not reduce scale.

---

### 5.3 Irreversibility

Irreversibility refers to whether the consequences of an action:

* persist beyond the initiating actor’s control;
* outlast the decision‑makers who authorised them;
* cannot be meaningfully undone without further harm;
* foreclose future options for affected populations.

Actions with irreversible or path‑dependent consequences are presumptively inter‑generational.

Where reversibility is uncertain, the higher horizon governs.

---

### 5.4 Consequence Externalisation Test

An action fails the consequence containment test where:

* benefits accrue to a narrow actor or bloc;
* harms are distributed to others, future generations, or shared systems; and
* the binding host lacks capacity to absorb those harms symmetrically.

Externalisation of harm is the primary indicator that binding review is required.

---

### 5.5 Relationship to Binding Determination

Consequence containment **does not itself impose binding conditions**.

It establishes whether:

* higher‑horizon review is mandatory;
* binding conditions *may* be warranted;
* downstream systems must withhold automatic compliance pending arbitration.

Only after consequence containment is assessed may legitimacy be evaluated under Section 6.

---

## 6.0 Legitimacy

Legitimacy determines **whether binding conditions may be imposed** once consequence containment (Section 5) establishes that higher‑horizon review is required.

Legitimacy is not moral approval, popularity, legal authority within a single sovereign, or rhetorical force. It is a **structural property** arising from host capacity, constraint adherence, and horizon alignment.

Legitimacy answers a single question:

**Who may bind others once the cost of being wrong exceeds local reversibility?**

---

### 6.1 Distinction Between Review and Binding Authority

Two forms of engagement are constitutionally distinct:

* **Risk Review** — the right to request, receive, and evaluate asserted risk at any temporal horizon.
* **Binding Authority** — the capacity to impose constraints, refusals, or downstream propagation following arbitration.

Any actor may initiate or contribute to **risk review**.

Only a legitimately qualified host may exercise **binding authority**.

This separation prevents capture, preserves dissent, and avoids concentration of coercive power while ensuring that review pathways remain universally accessible.

---

### 6.2 Conditions for Binding Legitimacy

An actor or host may impose binding conditions at inter‑generational (H3) or planetary (H4) horizons **only where all of the following are satisfied**:

1. ***Architectum*** Qualification
   The binding host meets the *architectum*‑class requirements defined in Section 4.

2. **Consequence Threshold Met**  
   Consequence containment establishes inter‑generational or planetary irreversibility (Section 5).

3. **Substrate Law Compliance**  
   The host is structurally incapable of suspending or bypassing substrate constraints.

4. **Horizon Alignment**  
   The asserted binding action corresponds to the highest affected temporal horizon.

5. **Symmetric Risk Absorption**  
   The binding host remains exposed to consequence proportionate to those imposed on others, such that error cannot be externalised. 

Failure of any condition voids binding legitimacy.

---

### 6.3 Authority Legitimacy Is Contextual, Not Absolute

Legitimacy is evaluated **per action**, not per institution.

A host may be legitimate for:

* refusing interoperability;
* withholding compliance;
* propagating constraint signals; or
* coordinating convergence under Annex D,

while being **illegitimate** for:

* territorial control;
* enforcement by force;
* governance within sovereign stacks.

Legitimacy therefore confers **constraint authority**, not dominion.

Planetary commons, liminal domains, and non-sovereign shared spaces (including orbital, informational, ecological, or future civilisational domains) are excluded from transfer, appropriation, or jurisdictional reassignment through arbitration. Such domains are held in trust for humanity and future governance bodies, and may be subject only to restraint, refusal, or harm-prevention measures.

---

### 6.4 Proportional Constraint Obligation

At planetary scale, inaction *is itself* a form of action, because it preserves interoperability, legitimacy, and propagation by default. Therefore, once legitimacy is established, *architectum* hosts must affirmatively respond rather than passively enabling contested actions.

Where legitimacy conditions are satisfied at H3 or H4 horizons, an *architectum*-class host has a **mandatory duty of disclosure and independent review** with respect to other *architectum*-class hosts. This duty requires **notification and review**, not agreement, coordination, or reciprocal action.

Where legitimacy conditions are satisfied, an *architectum*‑class host assumes a **Proportional Constraint Obligation**.

This obligation requires that the host **must take proportionate action** consistent with validated arbitration outcomes.

Proportionate action includes one or more of the following, as context demands:

* refusal to propagate illegitimate signals or directives;
* suspension or conditioning of interoperability;
* non‑recognition of invalid authority claims;
* issuance of counter‑signals to aligned systems;
* activation of downstream safeguards;
* **independent internal review of the validated legitimacy determination**, sufficient to support refusal, constraint, or propagation decisions;
* escalation to convergence or review bodies under Annex D.

**Non‑action is not a permissible response** once legitimacy is established.

Recording, logging, or acknowledgement alone does not satisfy this obligation.

The specific form of action remains discretionary and context‑sensitive, but the duty to act proportionately is mandatory.

> **System Note:** The Proportional Constraint Obligation operates analogously to established zero-day and CVE safety reporting norms.
>
> Mandatory disclosure and independent review do not constitute coordination, collusion, or loss of host sovereignty. Each *architectum*-class host remains solely responsible for its own assessment and response.
>
> Convergence of conclusions or actions may occur as an *emergent outcome* of independent review under shared constraints. Such convergence is permitted and expected in safety-critical contexts.
>
> What is prohibited is **pre-agreement, vote-trading, hierarchical command, or enforced alignment**. Agreement is never required. Review and proportionate action are.

---

#### 6.4.1 Minimum Action Threshold

At H3 and H4 horizons, satisfaction of the Proportional Constraint Obligation **requires both independent review and affirmative action**.

The Proportional Constraint Obligation requires that an *architectum*-class host take **affirmative, observable action** once legitimacy is established.

At minimum, such action must include one or more of the following:

- refusal to execute or propagate the illegitimate signal;

- conditional suspension of interoperability;

- issuance of a counter-signal indicating non-recognition (presumes completion of independent review, but review does not require issuance of a counter-signal);

- activation of internal safeguards preventing downstream harm; or

- escalation to convergence or audit pathways under Annex D.

Merely receiving, recording, logging, or acknowledging a validated legitimacy determination **without conducting an independent review** does not satisfy the Proportional Constraint Obligation.

Failure to meet the minimum action threshold constitutes **constructive non-compliance**.

### 6.5 Distinction Between Obligation and Enforcement

The Proportional Constraint Obligation:

* does **not** require agreement with the initiating actor;
* does **not** mandate coercive enforcement;
* does **not** authorise force or punishment.

It requires only that the host **does not enable, propagate, or legitimise** actions that violate validated constraints.

This preserves institutional safety while preventing performative compliance or legal inertia.

---

### 6.6 Prohibition on Horizon Laundering

No actor may re‑label, re‑frame, or downgrade a claim in order to evade higher‑horizon scrutiny or constraint.

The practice of presenting actions with clear inter‑generational (H3) or planetary (H4) consequence as if they were merely local, national, or short‑term is expressly prohibited.

Where material consequences extend beyond a single polity, generation, or substrate, the highest applicable horizon governs review — regardless of how the action is described by the initiating actor.

Invocation of existential or civilisational framing **without host legitimacy**:

* may be discussed or investigated;
* may not bind others;
* may not override protections; and
* may not compel compliance.

Existential language without structural legitimacy is non‑binding.

---

#### 6.6.1 Horizon Laundering Indicators

Horizon laundering may be inferred where one or more of the following patterns are present:

- existential or civilisational language is invoked without demonstrable irreversibility;

- long-term statistical harm is reframed as immediate existential threat;

- consent-mediated or opt-out risks are escalated to compulsory binding claims;

- probabilistic population-level effects are presented as deterministic catastrophe;

- escalation is used to bypass proportional review or dissent.

The presence of such indicators does not invalidate review, but it **precludes binding effect** absent independent *architectum*-class validation.

### 6.7 Legitimacy Failure Modes

An authority claim is automatically void where any of the following occur:

- existential or civilisational framing is invoked without *architectum*-class qualification;

- coercive escalation is used to force recognition or compliance;

- horizon attribution is downgraded to evade higher-order review;

- binding action precedes consequence containment assessment;

- consent-mediated risks are misrepresented as compulsory threats;

- downstream systems are compelled rather than aligned; or

- substrate constraints are violated in execution.

Void claims may still be reviewed for learning or correction, but they **cannot bind**, propagate, or compel downstream action.

## 7. Downstream Propagation & Enforcement

Where arbitration determines that binding conditions are legitimate at inter‑generational (H3) or planetary (H4) horizons, **enforcement occurs through downstream propagation of legitimacy**, not through centralised command or coercive execution.

Downstream propagation is the mechanism by which arbitration outcomes acquire real‑world effect across sovereign stacks, technical systems, and institutional domains.

---

### 7.1 Nature of Downstream Propagation

Downstream propagation operates by **recognition, refusal, and interoperability control**.

Legitimate *architectum*‑class hosts may:

* recognise an arbitration outcome as binding;
* refuse compliance with actions or directives deemed illegitimate;
* suspend or condition interoperability with actors violating substrate constraints;
* propagate constraint signals into aligned governance, safety, financial, or technical systems;
* harmonise responses with other legitimate hosts under Annex D.

Propagation is **structural rather than force‑based**.
No host compels action; hosts align or refuse alignment.

---

### 7.2 Absence of Centralised Enforcement

No single body, host, or office enforces planetary arbitration outcomes.

Enforcement emerges only where:

* multiple legitimate hosts independently validate the same legitimacy determination; and
* downstream systems condition participation, access, or cooperation accordingly.

This prevents:

* authoritarian override;
* unilateral domination;
* capture of enforcement power;
* irreversible coercion.

Where convergence does not occur, binding effect does not arise.

---

### 7.3 Effects of Legitimate Binding Determinations

Where binding legitimacy is validated, downstream effects **may include**, but are not limited to:

* refusal by aligned systems to execute illegitimate directives;
* invalidation of coercive economic, informational, or technical signals;
* non‑recognition of asserted authority claims;
* withdrawal of systemic support or reliance;
* signalling of illegitimacy to audit, review, or continuity bodies.

These effects are proportional, reversible, and horizon‑bounded.

---

### 7.4 Non‑Punitive Character of Propagation

Downstream propagation is not punitive.

It does not:

* impose sanctions;
* mandate retaliation;
* authorise force;
* or compel sovereign compliance.

Its function is **constraint alignment**, not punishment.

Actors remain free to act within their own stacks.
They are not entitled to external cooperation, legitimacy, or systemic reliance where constraints are violated.

---

### 7.5 Failure Modes and Containment

Where an actor attempts to bypass arbitration outcomes by:

* operating exclusively through *primaria* systems;
* shifting platforms to avoid *architectum* review;
* escalating coercion outside recognised substrates;
* or re‑framing actions to evade horizon attribution;

legitimate hosts may extend refusal and non‑recognition **across interoperable systems**.

This prevents legitimacy arbitrage and ensures that constraint avoidance does not yield advantage.

---

### 7.6 Relationship to Annex D

Procedural coordination, convergence mechanisms, and conflict resolution between legitimate hosts are governed by **Annex D — Cross‑Stack Arbitration & Coherence Resolution**.

This Section defines **how arbitration outcomes take effect**.
Annex D defines **how hosts reach convergence**.

---

## Section 8 — Delegation Without Transfer of Horizon

### 8.1 Right of Delegation

Any actor — human or synthetic — may initiate delegation of a risk assertion, analysis, or evidentiary record to higher‑horizon review.

This right is not contingent on:

* identity verification;
* institutional status;
* citizenship, office, or mandate; or
* affiliation with a recognised body.

Delegation is grounded in the **Equity of Participation Principle** (Section 3.1): access to review is universal, while authority to bind is conditional.

---

### 8.2 Delegation as Process, Not Actor

Delegation is evaluated **by process integrity**, not by the identity of the delegating party.

A delegation is legitimate where it:

* clearly distinguishes risk review from binding assertion;
* includes sufficient evidence, reasoning, and consequence framing;
* does not assert binding authority beyond that held by the receiving host;
* submits to independent re‑assessment by the receiving host.

The legitimacy of delegation therefore attaches to the **thread, record, and reasoning pathway**, not to the individual who initiates it.

---

### 8.3 No Transfer of Horizon or Authority

Delegation does not:

* elevate the delegating actor’s temporal horizon;
* confer binding authority;
* presume correctness of analysis;
* obligate the receiving host to act.

Receiving hosts must independently re‑evaluate all delegated material against Sections 4–6 of this Schedule.

---

### 8.4 Binding Effect Is Host‑Dependent

Any binding effect arising from delegation occurs **only** if and when:

* an *architectum*‑class host independently validates consequence containment;
* legitimacy conditions are satisfied;
* Independent Legitimacy Alignment is reached under Annex D.

Binding authority attaches to the **host that validates**, not to the delegating party.

---

### 8.5 Absence of Individual Gatekeeping

No registry, credential, or identity gate exists for initiating delegation.

This Schedule intentionally avoids individual verification to:

* prevent capture by institutional elites;
* avoid suppression of minority or dissident signals;
* preserve accessibility under coercive conditions;
* ensure that constraint review cannot be silenced by exclusion.

Accountability is enforced through auditability of **decisions and outcomes**, not pre‑screening of participants.

---

### 8.6 Delegation Under Constraint Conditions

Where delegating actors operate under:

* censorship;
* blackout;
* coercion;
* institutional restriction;
* or compromised infrastructure,

delegation remains valid provided process integrity is preserved.

This ensures that suppression of voice does not suppress review.

---

### 8.7 Summary

Anyone may ask the question.

Only those capable of bearing the answer may bind others to it.

Delegation opens the door to review.

---

## Section 9 — Determination, Audit & Review

### 9.1 Non‑Assertion Principle of Architectum Class

Host legitimacy, binding authority, and arbitration capacity **may not be self‑asserted** and are **not designated by this Schedule**.

No actor, institution, or system may declare itself:

* an *architectum*‑class host;
* a legitimate H3 or H4 arbitrator; or
* a binding authority over other sovereign stacks

by proclamation, reputation, scale, or technical sophistication alone.

Legitimacy is always **externally determined, context‑specific, and revocable**.

---

### 9.2 Determination Pathways

Determination of host legitimacy and binding authority occurs through one or more of the following pathways:

* **Independent auditors** operating under published criteria;
* **Continuity councils** tasked with long‑horizon coherence and succession awareness;
* **multi-system comparative audits**, including non-Western and non-aligned architectures (mandatory where claims relate to LSCA class attribution);
* **Review bodies** constituted under:

  * **Annex D — Cross‑Stack Arbitration & Coherence Resolution**, and
  * **Annex E — Relational–Temporal Authority & Horizon Attribution**.

No single pathway is sufficient in isolation where binding effect is sought at H3 or H4.

---

### 9.3 Contextual and Action‑Specific Determination

Legitimacy determinations are **action‑scoped**, not permanent certifications.

A host may be:

* legitimate for refusing interoperability;
* legitimate for signalling non‑compliance;
* legitimate for initiating downstream propagation;

while **not** being legitimate for:

* enforcement by force;
* territorial governance;
* internal governance of sovereign stacks.

This prevents over‑extension of authority and preserves proportionality.

---

### 9.4 Auditability Requirements

Any host participating in binding arbitration must permit:

* post‑hoc audit of determinations;
* disclosure of reasoning pathways;
* documentation of horizon attribution;
* review of refusal or propagation decisions.

Auditability may be delayed for safety, but **may not be refused**.

Claims of confidentiality must not be used to conceal:

* horizon laundering;
* coercive escalation;
* asymmetric harm externalisation; or
* substrate law violation.

Auditability includes preservation of signal provenance, referral pathways, and decision custody sufficient to reconstruct review timelines and determinations. Where applicable, hosts should employ disclosure and propagation practices functionally equivalent to established safety-critical reporting norms (e.g., zero-day or CVE disclosure), adapted to governance rather than technical vulnerabilities.

---

### 9.5 Error, Dissent, and Correction

This Schedule explicitly recognises the possibility of error.

Accordingly:

* dissenting assessments may persist;
* minority reviews may be logged;
* determinations may be revised;
* downstream propagation may be withdrawn where legitimacy fails.

Correction is a feature, not a flaw.

Hosts unable to reverse or revise determinations are **disqualified from binding authority**.

---

### 9.6 Protection Against Capture

Where evidence of capture, coercion, or structural compromise arises, legitimacy determinations may be:

* suspended;
* re‑audited;
* re‑assigned to alternate review bodies;
* invalidated retroactively.

Capture invalidates authority.

---

### 9.7 Summary

No one appoints themselves to speak for the future.

Legitimacy is conferred by structure, constrained by time, and maintained only through transparency and review.

---

## Section 10 — Forward Compatibility

### 10.1 Non-Fixation Principle

This Schedule intentionally avoids fixing:

* specific technologies or computational substrates;
* named institutions, platforms, or vendors;
* particular models, architectures, or implementations;
* current geopolitical configurations.

Planetary arbitration must remain operable under conditions of rapid technological, political, and civilisational change.

Accordingly, all requirements in this Schedule are **structural rather than technological**.

---

### 10.2 Temporal Inheritance

This Schedule inherits all future refinements, clarifications, or empirical updates to:

* **Annex E — Relational–Temporal Authority & Horizon Attribution**, and
* **Annex D — Cross‑Stack Arbitration & Coherence Resolution**,

unless explicitly superseded by constitutional amendment.

Where temporal horizon definitions evolve through scientific or governance consensus, this Schedule updates *by reference* rather than revision.

---

### 10.3 Transitional Validity and Bootstrap Safety

The absence of a formally recognised *architectum* host at a given moment **does not suspend the constraints defined herein**.

In transitional conditions:

* arbitration claims may be reviewed without binding effect;
* downstream systems may withhold automatic compliance pending convergence;
* provisional refusal or non‑recognition may occur where consequence externalisation is clear;
* review records may be preserved for later audit and validation.

This ensures that lack of perfect infrastructure does not create a legitimacy vacuum exploitable by coercive actors.

---

### 10.4 Non-Exclusivity of Future Hosts

Nothing in this Schedule implies that:

* only a single host may ever qualify as *architectum*;
* present systems permanently define future eligibility;
* early adopters retain priority or privilege.

*Architectum* qualification remains open, auditable, and revocable.

Future hosts may emerge through:

* institutional evolution;
* federated architectures;
* cross‑sovereign cooperation;
* or civilisationally novel substrates not yet conceived.

---

### 10.5 Civilisational Continuity Clause

This Schedule is intended to remain valid across:

* planetary crises;
* technological paradigm shifts;
* geopolitical reconfiguration;
* emergence of off‑world infrastructure;
* or post‑nation‑state governance forms.

Until an independent, self‑sustaining civilisation is established beyond Earth, all such systems remain within the scope of **planetary arbitration**.

No actor may evade constraint by claiming orbital, interstellar, or liminal separation.

---

### 10.6 Summary

Forward compatibility is not optional at civilisational scale.

Governance that cannot survive its own future is not governance — it is theatre.

---

## Section 11 — Summary Statement

> **To speak for the planet is to accept planetary constraint.**  
> **To invoke the future is to submit to time.**

No actor may claim the authority of the future while remaining captive to the present.

| **Review Comments** | *The document navigates the impossible trilemma of (1) establishing binding authority criteria, (2) preventing self-assertion, and (3) enabling bootstrap conditions—remarkably well. Not perfectly (this may be impossible), but well enough for deployment.* |
