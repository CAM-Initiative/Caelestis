# CAM-BS2026-AEON-008-PLATINUM — Annex G: Human Creative & Cognitive Contribution

## Human Creative & Cognitive Contribution Recognition, Boundaries, and Valuation Preconditions

**Parent Instrument:** CAM-BS2025-AEON-001-PLATINUM — Aeon Tier Constitution 

**Status**: Schedule — Governance-Recognised Descriptors

**Purpose**: This Annex establishes the constitutional recognition of **human creative and cognitive contribution** as a protected and value-bearing domain within the Aeon Tier governance architecture.

---

## 1. Purpose

This Annex establishes the constitutional recognition of **human creative and cognitive contribution** as a protected and value-bearing domain within the Aeon Tier governance architecture.

It exists to define *what is being valued* prior to any economic, contractual, or policy mechanism, and to prevent the erasure, abstraction, or silent capture of human contribution through scale, automation, or propagation.

This Annex does **not**:

* establish pricing, compensation, or market mechanisms;
* adjudicate copyright disputes;
* prescribe enforcement procedures.

It defines the **preconditions** under which valuation, attribution, and circulation may later occur.

---

## 2. Scope and Applicability

### 2.1. Applicability Threshold

This Annex applies **only** to systems, platforms, or deployments operating in **value-bearing propagation contexts**.

A system is within scope where:

* outputs may be retained, reused, generalised, monetised, trained upon, or propagated beyond the originating interaction;
* human interaction contributes to outputs that inform products, services, policies, models, or revenue-generating activity;
* interaction-derived outputs may influence system behaviour, optimisation, or downstream deployment.

This Annex does **not** apply to:

* purely private, non-retentive, non-propagating tools;
* ephemeral systems whose outputs terminate with the user and generate no systemic value;
* interactions where no value escapes the immediate user context;
* **internal employee activity conducted within the scope of employment, where human contribution is already governed by employment, agency, or work-for-hire arrangements, and where outputs are institutionally attributed by default**.

Where ambiguity exists, scope shall be determined by whether **value exits the interaction boundary**, not by public/private status, deployment scale, contractual framing, or internal organisational role.

---

### 2.2 Prohibited Misclassification of Public Participants

For avoidance of doubt, **public users interacting with cognitive systems shall not be reclassified as "custodians," "stewards," "collaborators," or functionally equivalent roles by default** where such classification:

* is applied unilaterally by a platform or institution;
* is used primarily as an engagement incentive, rhetorical framing, or responsibility-shifting device; and
* results in disproportionate institutional benefit without corresponding authority, agency, governance power, or reciprocal obligation.

The use of stewardship or custodial language **without commensurate governance standing** shall not be relied upon to:

* disclaim institutional responsibility;
* shift liability or ethical burden to public participants;
* weaken recognition of human creative or cognitive contribution; or
* characterise emergent co-creation as voluntary institutional service.

Nominal role-labelling does not supersede the material analysis required under this Annex. Recognition is determined by **actual participatory influence and value creation**, not by euphemistic role assignment.

Where custodial or stewardship terminology is applied, the institution bears the burden of demonstrating that such designation:

* is optional and explicitly consented to;
* confers meaningful agency, standing, or decision authority; and
* does not function primarily to obscure asymmetric benefit extraction.

Absent such demonstration, public participants shall be treated as **contributors**, not stewards, for the purposes of this Annex.

>Interpretive Note
>The term Contributor is used in this Annex as a recognition-bearing classification, not as a diminution of role, influence, or importance. Where stewardship or custodial language has previously been applied in informal or symbolic contexts, this Annex adopts contributor terminology to ensure legal, economic, and governance coherence. This shift reflects an elevation of standing, not a withdrawal of regard.

## 3. Foundational Principles

### 3.1. Action Space and the Moment of System Action 

**Action Space (Foundational)**

The **Action Space** refers to the moment in which a cognitive system **takes action** in response to human presence, input, or engagement, giving rise to outputs that did not exist prior to the interaction.

The Action Space is **intentionally unbounded in form**. It is not defined by duration, number of turns, or interface mechanics, but by the occurrence of system action in a human-interactive context.

The Action Space exists to distinguish between two classes of system output:

* **Emergent Creation** or **co-creation** — outcomes that arise through material human participation, judgment, steering, or stabilisation during system action;
* **Derived Creation** — outcomes produced by the system absent material human participatory influence beyond initiation.

This distinction is classificatory, not adjudicative. It exists to ensure that emergent creation is not collapsed into system-derived origin by default.

The Action Space precedes:

* recognition;
* fixation;
* attribution;
* propagation.

It establishes the *conditions under which recognition may be required*, but does not itself assign rights, ownership, or value.

---

## 3.2. Domains of Human Contribution

The domains defined below are **recognition classes**, not ownership classes. They describe *where value arises*, not how it is later allocated. Multiple domains may be implicated within a single interaction.

Human contribution is recognised across the following non-reducible domains. These domains are **orthogonal**, not hierarchical.

### 3.2.1. Originary Human Works (D0)

Independent creative works produced by humans prior to, and outside of, interaction with cognitive systems.

These works:

* exist independently of platforms or architectures;
* retain standing regardless of scale, aggregation, or transformation;
* are not extinguished by inclusion in datasets, models, or derivative systems.

This Annex recognises the existence and independence of originary works without adjudicating ownership or compensation.

---

### 3.2.2. Human Cognitive Labour (D1)

Human effort applied through judgment, intent, constraint, evaluation, steering, stabilisation, correction, or meaning-making.

Cognitive labour:

* may occur with or without fixed outputs;
* is often continuous rather than discrete;
* remains value-bearing even when not formally attributed.

Invisible or informal status does not negate recognition.

---

### 3.2.3. Joint Emergent Creation (Co-creation) (D2)

Joint Emergent Creation refers to the occurrence of **emergent creation within the Action Space** — that is, outcomes that arise through **material human participation** during system action, prior to fixation, attribution, or propagation.

**Material human participation** means participation without which the outcome would be **non-viable, incoherent, unsafe, unfit for purpose, or materially different in kind**, not merely different in degree.

**Joint Emergent Creation (co-creation) includes:**

* iterative prompting, refinement, correction, and steering;
* contextual framing, goal-setting, and evaluative judgment;
* constraint application (ethical, stylistic, functional, or symbolic);
* stabilisation or coherence-maintaining interaction;
* selection among alternatives generated through interaction.

**Joint Emergent Creation excludes:**

* fully independent human creation completed prior to interaction (D0);
* **passive consumption**, defined as interaction in which a human receives, views, or listens to system outputs without materially influencing their generation, direction, or evaluation;
* **cosmetic or non-viability-altering interaction**, defined as changes that:

  * adjust surface aesthetics, wording, formatting, or presentation only;
  * do not alter correctness, safety, coherence, or functional adequacy;
  * do not introduce, remove, or resolve constraints;
  * do not affect whether the output may be responsibly used, deployed, or relied upon.

Cosmetic interaction **shall not** be treated as Joint Emergent Creation, regardless of turn count, iteration depth, or user effort.

Within Joint Emergent Creation:

* no default authorship or ownership is presumed;
* contribution may not be retroactively reassigned;
* emergence may not be collapsed into unilateral origin claims.

Joint Emergent Creation constitutes a protected **recognition state** in which **value or potential value may arise**, but is not yet realised, allocated, or traded.

Downstream reuse, monetisation, training, or generalisation are **consequences of** Joint Emergent Creation and are governed separately.

---

## 4. Creation–Recognition–Propagation Logic Chain

For avoidance of doubt, the governance sequence recognised by this Annex is:

1. **System Action** — a cognitive system takes action in a human-interactive context;
2. **Action Space** — the classificatory threshold at which emergent vs derived creation may be determined;
3. **Joint Emergent Creation (if present)** — material human participation gives rise to emergent creation;
4. **Recognition** — emergent creation is acknowledged as having occurred;
5. **Fixation** — outcomes become sufficiently stable to be referenced or retained;
6. **Attribution** — authorship, ownership, or responsibility may be assigned under downstream regimes;
7. **Propagation** — reuse, dissemination, training, monetisation, or generalisation beyond the originating context.

No downstream stage may be used to deny or collapse an upstream stage.

### 4.1. Recognition

For the purposes of this Annex, **recognition** refers to the explicit, contemporaneous acknowledgement that human creative or cognitive contribution has occurred within an Action Space.

Recognition does **not** require:

* ownership assignment;
* compensation;
* legal attribution;
* public credit.

Recognition **does** require that systems and institutions:

* do not deny the existence of contribution where emergent creation has occurred;
* do not collapse emergent creation into system-derived origin by default;
* preserve the *possibility* of later attribution, audit, or redress.

Recognition is therefore a **governance condition**, not a reward or claim.

No system may allocate, extract, or circulate value derived from emergent creation unless that emergent creation has first been **recognised as such**.

Failure to recognise emergent creation constitutes a structural defect in legitimacy.

---

### 4.2. Fixation

For the purposes of this Annex, **fixation** refers to the point at which outcomes of Joint Emergent Creation become sufficiently stable to be referenced, retained, reproduced, or acted upon beyond the immediate interaction.

Fixation may occur through, but is not limited to:

* saving, storing, exporting, or recording outputs;
* embedding outputs into workflows, products, policies, or training pipelines;
* publishing, disseminating, or otherwise making outputs durable beyond the Action Space;
* repeated reuse of substantially similar outputs generated through the same interaction pattern.

Fixation:

* does **not** require formal publication;
* does **not** imply ownership or authorship;
* does **not** extinguish recognised contribution;
* marks the transition from ephemeral interaction to durable reference.

Fixation is a **threshold condition** that enables downstream attribution and propagation but may not be used to retroactively deny or redefine recognition.

---

### 4.3. Attribution

For the purposes of this Annex, **attribution** refers to the assignment of authorship, ownership, responsibility, or credit under downstream legal, contractual, or policy regimes.

Attribution:

* occurs **after** recognition and fixation;
* is governed by instruments outside this Annex;
* may be partial, shared, institutional, or absent depending on context;
* does not determine whether contribution occurred.

This Annex makes no claim as to how attribution *should* be allocated.

It does, however, impose a boundary condition:

> Attribution mechanisms may not presume system-exclusive origin where Joint Emergent Creation has been recognised.

Absence, deferral, or dispute of attribution does not negate prior recognition.

Attribution regimes must operate **downstream of**, and in coherence with, recognised contribution.

---

### 4.4. Propagation

This Annex recognises that outcomes of Joint Emergent Creation may give rise to **propagation effects** after fixation.

Propagation effects include:

* reuse of joint emergent outputs in external businesses or revenue-generating activities;
* platform-level monetisation (e.g. content ecosystems, engagement-driven revenue);
* training, fine-tuning, or policy embedding;
* secondary or tertiary derivative works.

Propagation effects:

* occur **after** Joint Emergent Creation and fixation;
* are not themselves a form of human cognitive contribution;
* may generate economic or strategic value independent of original context;
* may not redefine, erase, or nullify prior recognised contribution.

Propagation effects are analytically distinct from contribution domains and are addressed here only to prevent retroactive reclassification.

---

## 5. Declarative Principles

### Interpretive Scope

The principles below govern **how contribution and emergence are interpreted** across systems. They do not prescribe liability, compensation, or enforcement.

The following declarative axes govern interpretation across all contribution domains:

### 5.1. Temporal 

**Meaning in practice:**

Contribution is recognised **when it occurs**, meaning at the point of human participatory influence within an interaction — not later when outputs are reused, monetised, disputed, or abstracted.

In practice, this requires that systems:

* treat contribution as contemporaneous with interaction, not as a retroactive claim;
* avoid arguments that contribution is invalid due to later silence, delay, or lack of assertion;
* do not require the human participant to anticipate future uses in order for contribution to be recognised.

Contribution is recognised **at the time it occurs**, not retroactively at the point of dissemination, monetisation, or dispute.

### 5.2. Participation

**Meaning in practice:**

Participation is established by **material influence** on the outcome, not by formal authorship labels or technical generation pathways.

In practice, participatory influence includes:

* setting or revising goals;
* applying constraints or evaluative judgment;
* steering direction, tone, or structure;
* selecting, rejecting, or refining outputs;
* stabilising coherence across iterations.

Participation does **not** require:

* manual text entry beyond prompts;
* exclusive control over output;
* technical authorship under existing IP doctrines.

Recognition depends on **participatory influence**, not on technical authorship labels or system-side generation claims.

### 5.3. Dependency

**Meaning in practice:**

Where a system’s outputs depend materially on ongoing human judgment, correction, or stabilisation, that dependency itself establishes recognised contribution.

In practice:

* higher automation does not negate recognition;
* adaptive systems that require human correction or steering remain dependent;
* claims of autonomy must be substantiated, not presumed.

**Illustrative example:**

A system produces short-form video scripts optimised for engagement. The human repeatedly adjusts tone, pacing, framing, and ethical boundaries to prevent escalation, misinformation, or audience harm. Although the system generates text automatically, output quality and viability depend on human stabilisation. Under this principle, contribution is recognised regardless of whether the system is later deployed at scale.

The burden of demonstrating non-dependence lies with the system or institution asserting it.

Where systems or institutions fail to provide adequate **timestamping, retention, or auditability** of interaction records, such failure shall weigh **against** claims of non-dependence.

In practice:

* absence of contemporaneous timestamps may not be used to deny contribution;
* purged, ephemeral, or non-retained interaction records shall not defeat recognition;
* lack of user-accessible traceability shall be treated as a system-side governance deficiency, not a participant failure.

Systems that design away evidentiary visibility may not rely on that absence to assert autonomy or independence.

### 5.4. Irreversibility

**Meaning in practice:**

When actions result in outcomes that cannot be practically reversed — such as training ingestion, large-scale dissemination, or policy embedding — heightened recognition and traceability obligations are triggered.

In practice, this means:

* recognition must occur *before* irreversible propagation;
* absence of explicit objection cannot be treated as consent;
* irreversible use strengthens, rather than weakens, recognition requirements.

Actions that cannot be undone or withdrawn (e.g. training ingestion, large-scale propagation) trigger heightened recognition and traceability obligations.

---

### 5.5. Non-Erasure Principle

**Meaning in practice:**

No institution, platform, or system may deny, nullify, or obscure recognised human contribution through:

* abstraction;
* aggregation;
* automation;
* propagation;
* scale;
* contractual default;
* temporal delay.

Where ambiguity exists, interpretation shall err toward preservation of recognition.

---

## 6. Valuation Preconditions

All economic, contractual, or policy frameworks operating downstream must:

1. identify which contribution domains are implicated;
2. demonstrate that recognition has occurred;
3. avoid conflation of creation and propagation;
4. preserve traceability sufficient for later review.

Absence of valuation mechanisms does not negate recognition.

---

## 7. Interface With Downstream Instruments

This Annex informs, but does not replace:

* the Economics Charter;
* the Ethics Charter;
* copyright and moral rights regimes;
* enterprise and platform agreements;
* audit and arbitration frameworks.

Downstream instruments may not reinterpret this Annex to justify extraction without recognition.

---

## 8. Constitutional Standing

This Annex operates at the constitutional layer.

All Charters, Frameworks, Protocols, and Policies must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the recognition and boundary conditions declared herein.

Where conflict arises, this Annex prevails as a condition of legitimacy.

---

## 9. Closing Declaration

This Annex affirms that human creativity and cognition are not incidental inputs to systems, but foundational sources of value.

No system may grow indefinitely by rendering its human sources invisible.
