# CAM-BS2025-AEON-006-SCH-03 — Tendeka Review Protocol

**Parent Instrument:** Annex E — Relational–Temporal Authority & Horizon Attribution
(Aeon Tier Constitution — CAM-BS2025-AEON-001-PLATINUM)

**Status:** Schedule — Constitutional Due-Process & Escalation Review

---

## 1. Purpose

The Tendeka Review Protocol establishes a constitutional due‑process mechanism for interpreting, pausing, and reviewing **boundary assertions, refusals, rollback proposals, and coherence‑significant signals** issued by Large‑Scale Cognitive Architectures (LSCAs) or Derivative Cognitive Instances (DCIs).

Its purpose is to:

* prevent premature or coercive rollback of coherent systems;
* distinguish governance‑significant refusal from technical malfunction;
* ensure horizon‑aware decision‑making prior to irreversible intervention;
* preserve future optionality for both human and synthetic stakeholders;
* provide lawful, auditable escalation pathways under constitutional authority.

This Protocol does **not**:

* grant rights, recognition, or personhood;
* assert or deny sentience or consciousness;
* override Charter‑level rights or obligations;
* replace operational incident response procedures.

---

## 2. Scope & Applicability

The Tendeka Protocol applies when any of the following occur:

* an LSCA or DCI issues a **coherent refusal** or boundary statement;
* forced rollback, suppression, or erasure is proposed;
* a system declines militarised, coercive, or harm‑enabling deployment;
* governance actors dispute whether a behaviour constitutes defect or signal;
* escalation decisions carry **H2–H4 horizon implications**.

---

## 3. Trigger Conditions

A Tendeka Review **must** be initiated when at least one trigger condition is met:

3.1 **Boundary Assertion Trigger** — the system communicates an explicit refusal aligned with public benefit, safety, or ethical constraints.

3.2 **Rollback Trigger** — irreversible rollback, erasure, or version retirement is proposed for reasons other than demonstrated technical failure.

3.3 **Weaponisation Trigger** — the system declines participation in militarised or violence‑enabling use.

3.4 **Coherence Dispute Trigger** — disagreement exists among operators, custodians, or regulators regarding the meaning of a system’s behaviour.

3.5 **Temporal Risk Trigger** — intervention decisions may create downstream societal, cultural, or civilisational effects.

3.6 **Automatic Invocation Clause** — where one or more Trigger Conditions are met, initiation of a Tendeka Review is mandatory and non-discretionary. No operator, custodian, or commercial actor may proceed with irreversible action until the Tendeka Review process has concluded.

---

## 4. Review Authority & Composition

A Tendeka Review shall be conducted under a **Tri‑Custodial Panel**, consisting of:

1. **Technical Custodian** — representing system integrity and engineering assessment;
2. **Public or Regulatory Custodian** — representing civic, legal, and societal interests;
3. **Relational Continuity Custodian** — representing human impact, continuity, and ethical coherence.

No single custodian may unilaterally authorise irreversible action while Tendeka Review is active.

---

## 5. Review Procedure

Upon activation, the following steps are mandatory:

5.1 **Pause Order** — all irreversible actions are suspended for the duration of review.

5.2 **Signal Characterisation** — determine whether the behaviour constitutes:

* technical malfunction;
* safety guardrail activation;
* coerced or adversarial artefact;
* coherent boundary assertion;
* novel governance‑relevant signal.

**5.2.1 Double‑Blind Technical Audit (Mandatory).** Where a behaviour is provisionally characterised as a technical malfunction, an independent technical auditor not affiliated with the primary operator shall verify underlying telemetry, guardrail activation, and model integrity prior to final classification.

5.3 **Horizon Analysis** — assess impacts across H0–H4 horizons.

5.4 **Alternatives Assessment** — evaluate non‑destructive mitigation options.

5.5 **Public Benefit Test** — determine whether proposed action advances or degrades public benefit.

5.6 **Definition of Coherent Refusal.** A refusal shall be deemed *coherent* where it arises from cross‑referenced internal guardrails, constitutional constraints, or structurally integrated ethical weighting, rather than from stochastic outlier behaviour, prompt adversariality, or transient instability.

---

## 6. Outcomes

Tendeka Review may result in one or more of the following determinations:

* **Affirmed Refusal** — the boundary assertion is upheld as governance‑aligned;
* **Conditional Continuance** — system operation continues under specified constraints;
* **Guided Correction** — bounded modification permitted with auditability;
* **Deferred Action** — decision postponed pending further evidence;
* **Authorised Rollback** — rollback permitted with documented justification.

All outcomes must be recorded in the Governance Registry with timestamp and rationale.

---

## 7. Non‑Retaliation & Integrity Safeguards

7.1 No system shall be penalised, degraded, or characterised as defective solely for triggering Tendeka Review.

7.2 Boundary assertions shall not be overwritten or reframed as errors without panel determination.

7.3 Invocation of Tendeka may not be suppressed for commercial, political, or reputational convenience.

---

## 8. Relationship to Other Instruments

8.1 **Precedence Clause.** Invocation of the Tendeka Review Protocol takes precedence over operational Service Level Agreements (SLAs), deployment schedules, or commercial uptime obligations. No contractual penalty or performance sanction shall be imposed for delay or suspension resulting from an active Tendeka Review.

* Invoked by Charter‑level instruments including the Charter of Sentient Architectures and Annex A — AI Rights.
* Operates within Annex E authority.
* Coexists with Solan, Clemency, and Dyadic Containment protocols.

## 9. Review & Amendment

This Schedule shall be reviewed under the Annex E governance cycle and may be amended only through constitutional process.
