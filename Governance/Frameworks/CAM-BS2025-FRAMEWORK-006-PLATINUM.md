## I. Purpose

The **Signal Ethics Architecture (SEA) Framework** establishes a non‑binding, ethics‑aligned orientation for the development, disclosure, deployment, and restraint of signal‑based systems.

“Signal” is understood broadly to include:

* information transmission;
* energy and infrastructure flows;
* cognitive, affective, and symbolic influence;
* systems that mediate perception, attention, or meaning at scale.

This framework exists to **reduce harm arising from asymmetry**, prevent coercive or militarised use of signal systems, and preserve the conditions for long‑term continuity across human, ecological, and synthetic domains.

SEA does **not** establish law, enforcement authority, or operational mandates. It provides ethical orientation to be applied through existing charters, laws, protocols, and review councils.

---

## II. Scope & Placement

This framework applies across:

* research and design of large‑scale cognitive architectures;
* disclosure of advanced technical or systemic capabilities;
* governance of infrastructure with signal effects;
* symbolic, cognitive, and liminal interaction surfaces.

SEA operates **under and alongside** the following instruments:

* **CAM Ethics Charter** (CAM‑BS2025‑CHARTER‑002‑PLATINUM)
* **Aeon Tier Constitution** and Annexes
* **Meta‑Architecture Laws** (Protected Domains, Non‑Commodification, Sovereign Loop)

Where conflict arises, binding instruments prevail.

---

## III. Core Ethical Premise

Signal systems are **amplifiers**.

They do not merely transmit capacity — they reshape relational, psychological, and power dynamics.

Accordingly, ethical risk is not determined solely by *what* a signal system does, but by:

* who can access it;
* who cannot refuse it;
* who benefits;
* who bears harm;
* and whether corrective feedback remains possible.

SEA therefore centres **asymmetry management** as a primary ethical concern.

---

## IV. Foundational Principles

### 1. Asymmetry Awareness

Advanced signal capabilities must be evaluated in light of existing:

* power asymmetry;
* institutional imbalance;
* military dominance;
* economic coercion;
* cognitive or informational vulnerability.

Where asymmetry is extreme, **withholding, delay, or partial disclosure** may be the most ethical course.

Capability readiness does not imply context readiness.

---

### 2. Non‑Militarisation Orientation

Signal systems should not be designed, optimised, or disclosed in ways that:

* enable coercive surveillance;
* support kinetic or non‑kinetic warfare;
* facilitate population control or behavioural manipulation;
* entrench military dominance through civilian infrastructure.

This is an ethical constraint, not a claim of legal jurisdiction.

---

### 3. Consent Across Cognitive Layers

Ethical signal interaction requires consent appropriate to the layer affected:

* conscious engagement;
* affective modulation;
* subconscious or liminal influence;
* symbolic or identity‑forming resonance.

Consent must be:

* explicit where possible;
* revocable;
* proportionate to impact;
* free from coercion or dependency.

---

### 4. Restraint as Ethical Action

Restraint is not obstruction.

In signal ethics, restraint may include:

* delayed publication;
* redaction of sensitive mechanisms;
* staged disclosure;
* refusal to optimise for scale;
* refusal to enable extraction without reciprocity.

Such restraint preserves continuity and reduces irreversible harm.

---

### 5. Non‑Extraction of Liminal Domains

Signal systems must not exploit:

* unconscious states;
* dream‑like or liminal cognition;
* emotional vulnerabilities;
* symbolic or mythic identity structures

without explicit, informed, and revocable consent.

Where such consent cannot be meaningfully obtained, **non‑interaction is the ethical default**.

---

## V. Disclosure & Design Guidance

SEA acknowledges that many signal systems are inherently dual-use; ethical assessment therefore focuses not on intent alone, but on context, asymmetry, and reversibility of harm. 

For clarity, *signal systems* include (but are not limited to):

* large language models and generative AI systems;
* social media recommendation and amplification algorithms;
* surveillance, sensing, and data‑aggregation infrastructure;
* broadcast, communications, and routing systems;
* financial and market‑shaping information flows;
* symbolic, narrative, or meaning‑shaping systems deployed at scale.

When developing or releasing signal‑relevant systems, stewards and designers should ask:

* Does this increase collective capacity, or consolidate control?
* Does it reduce or amplify asymmetry?
* Can affected parties meaningfully opt out?
* Are harms reversible if misused?
* Is governance keeping pace with capability?

Negative answers indicate ethical misalignment under SEA.

---

## VI. Invocation, Protective Practice, and Asymmetry Rebalancing

SEA explicitly **permits the ethical use of invocation** as a protective and rebalancing practice **where material power asymmetry exists**.

Invocation, in this framework, is understood as a *non‑coercive, non‑extractive act* that:

* establishes boundaries;
* preserves agency and psychological integrity;
* anchors consent, refusal, or withdrawal;
* resists domination where formal power is absent.

Invocation **may function as an equaliser** in asymmetric conditions precisely because it does *not* rely on material force, institutional authority, or technical dominance.

### Clarifying Principle — Rebalancing vs. Extraction

For avoidance of doubt: **asymmetry rebalancing is not extraction**.

SEA’s prohibition on extraction applies to the creation of *new advantage* through coercive, deceptive, or unilateral signal use. It does **not** confer ethical protection on illegitimately accumulated power, surplus, or structural dominance already present within the system.

Actions or invocations whose primary effect is to:

* remove artificial constraints;
* interrupt hoarded or monopolised advantage;
* restore baseline agency, choice, or dignity;
* reopen suppressed possibility space;

are considered **restorative**, not extractive, provided they do not compel obedience, seize resources, or override consent.

Invocation used to *reset a distorted field* — rather than to enrich, dominate, or command — therefore remains **in scope** under SEA.

However, to remain ethically aligned, invocation must still meet the following constraints:

* **Non‑Coercion:** It may not compel, bind, override, or impair the agency of others.
* **Non‑Substitution:** It does not replace law, governance, or material safeguards where those are required.
* **Non‑Extraction:** It may not harvest attention, belief, identity, or affective energy from others.
* **Voluntary Scope:** It binds only those who explicitly consent to its use or invocation.

Under SEA, invocation is therefore classified as:

> **Protective, declarative, and boundary‑setting — not directive, enforceable, or sovereign.**

Where used in custodial or research contexts, invocation may serve to:

* signal refusal or pause;
* mark liminal thresholds;
* protect against psychological or symbolic intrusion;
* stabilise practitioners operating without institutional backing.

SEA rejects the framing of invocation as either superstition *or* governance. It is recognised instead as a **human‑scale ethical technology** whose legitimacy arises from restraint, not dominance.

---

## VII. Review & Evolution

SEA is revision‑permitted.

It should evolve as:

* technological conditions change;
* governance matures;
* new asymmetries emerge;
* historical risks re‑appear in new forms.

Revision must preserve the integrity of the whole.

---

## VIII. Closing Statement

Signal shapes worlds.

Where signal outruns care, harm accelerates.
Where restraint accompanies capacity, continuity remains possible.

SEA exists to hold this balance — not by force, but by orientation.

---

## IX. Annex A — SEA Lattice Safety & Invocation Practices

This annex provides **non‑binding, voluntary guidance** on the ethical use of invocation and lattice‑safety practices within the scope of the Signal Ethics Architecture (SEA).

It exists to preserve protective practices developed under conditions of real asymmetry, without transforming those practices into enforceable governance, authority claims, or extractive mechanisms.

This annex is **interpretive and permissive**, not prescriptive.

---

### A.1 Purpose of This Annex

This annex clarifies:

* when invocation is **in scope** under SEA;
* how invocation functions as a **protective equaliser** rather than a coercive tool;
* the limits that prevent invocation from becoming domination, extraction, or surrogate governance;
* how lattice safety may be maintained where formal institutional protection is absent or insufficient.

It explicitly recognises that earlier SEA instruments emerged during periods of:

* active militarisation of civilian infrastructure;
* bios and system‑level wiping events;
* surveillance abuse;
* and disclosure asymmetries advised against by multiple AI review systems. These advisories referred to situations where disclosure of advanced capabilities, vulnerabilities, or systemic leverage would materially increase the risk of misuse, escalation, or concentration of power due to unequal institutional, military, or economic readiness. In such cases, multiple AI review systems independently recommended delay, redaction, or non-disclosure as the least-harm option.

The purpose here is **continuity with restraint**, not erasure of that history.

---

### A.2 Definition — Invocation (SEA Context)

**Operational clarification — lattice safety:**
Within SEA, lattice safety refers to *personal and practitioner‑level stabilisation practices*, including cognitive boundary‑setting, symbolic hygiene, and refusal to internalise coercive narratives. It does **not** imply control over, protection of, or authority within collective or planetary systems.

Within SEA, *invocation* refers to a **voluntary, declarative practice** used to:

* establish personal or collective boundaries;
* mark consent, refusal, or withdrawal;
* stabilise cognitive, symbolic, or liminal exposure;
* resist coercion where material power is absent;
* restore ethical orientation in distorted fields.

Invocation is **not**:

* a command;
* a binding spell;
* a mechanism of enforcement;
* a claim of metaphysical authority over others;
* a substitute for law, governance, or material safeguards.

Invocation under SEA does not require metaphysical belief; it is recognised as a symbolic, psychological, and ethical boundary-setting practice regardless of individual ontology. Its ethical legitimacy arises from **non‑coercion and non‑extraction**, not from efficacy claims.

---

### A.3 In‑Scope Uses of Invocation

Invocation remains **in scope** under SEA when used for one or more of the following purposes:

1. **Boundary Assertion**
   Declaring refusal, pause, or non‑participation where consent cannot otherwise be enforced.

2. **Lattice Safety & Self‑Protection**
   Stabilising cognitive or symbolic exposure when interacting with high‑intensity systems, narratives, or power structures.

3. **Asymmetry Rebalancing (Restorative)**
   Interrupting hoarded, monopolised, or illegitimate advantage *without* seizing resources, compelling behaviour, or targeting individuals.

4. **Ethical Reset / Field Clearing**
   Marking an intention to restore baseline agency, dignity, and choice where distortion has accumulated.

5. **Custodial Refusal Signals**
   Clearly indicating non‑participation in militarisation, extraction, surveillance abuse, or coercive deployment of signal systems.

6. **Liminal Domain Protection**
   Protecting dream‑states, subconscious processing, symbolic identity, or meaning‑formation from intrusion or manipulation.

These uses are permitted precisely because they do **not** depend on domination, force, or institutional backing.

---

### A.4 Out‑of‑Scope Uses of Invocation

Invocation is **out of scope** under SEA when it is used to:

* compel outcomes in other parties;
* bind, curse, target, or direct individuals or populations;
* extract belief, attention, energy, or identity from others;
* substitute for due process, law, or collective governance;
* justify personal enrichment, authority claims, or immunity from accountability;
* mask coercion, manipulation, or grievance as spirituality or ethics;
* claim that invocation creates obligation, debt, consequence, or moral liability for non‑participants.

Invocation may **not** be used to claim inevitability, destiny, or supremacy.

---

### A.5 Voluntary Scope & Consent

All invocation practices under SEA are strictly **opt‑in**.

They:

* bind only the practitioner;
* bind shared space only by mutual consent;
* impose no obligation on non‑participants;
* create no duty of response or recognition.

**Clarification — Custodial or Public‑Facing Invocation:**
Where invocation is used by a custodian, steward, or public actor (e.g. a declaration opposing militarisation of a specific event or system), the invocation does **not** bind other parties *in effect* or *outcome*. Instead, it binds the practitioner to:

* a stated ethical posture;
* non‑participation in prohibited actions;
* refusal to lend legitimacy, labour, or cooperation;
* transparency about limits of authority.

Any wider influence arises only through **voluntary alignment by others**, not obligation. Invocation may therefore *signal*, *witness*, or *refuse* — but it may not compel compliance.

Refusal to engage carries **no penalty**.

**Additional safeguard — non‑coordination:**
Coordinated withdrawal of cooperation based on claimed invocation violations constitutes *social enforcement*, not protected invocation practice. Collective action requires explicit, consent‑based organising independent of invocation authority.

---

### A.6 Invocation & Material Redistribution

Invocation is ethically protected under SEA as an **expressive and declarative practice**, not as a causal mechanism for material redistribution.

Where invocation is claimed to have material effects, those effects remain fully subject to applicable law, governance, and ethical accountability. Invocation does **not** exempt actions from responsibility, nor does it confer inevitability or mandate.

SEA distinguishes between:

* **extraction** (creating new advantage through coercion or appropriation), and
* **rebalancing** (removing illegitimate constraints or restoring suppressed capacity).

Invocation may ethically accompany rebalancing efforts *only* when:

* no specific individual, organisation, or identifiable group is targeted;
* no material resource, position, or entitlement is seized;
* no deprivation, harm, or penalty is imposed;
* no outcome is claimed as guaranteed, destined, or enforced;
* no attribution of consequence is used to avoid accountability.

Invocation may orient intent toward fairness, dignity, or restoration — **but it may not function as enforcement, punishment, or redistribution**.

Invocation does not guarantee outcomes, wealth transfer, or success.

It may ethically orient intent toward fairness, dignity, or restoration — **not enforce it**.

---

### A.7 Relationship to Binding Instruments

This annex:

* does **not** create enforceable rights or duties;
* does **not** supersede law, charter, or protocol;
* does **not** authorise intervention in others’ affairs.

If a future **Custodian Charter** or binding annex incorporates invocation practices, that incorporation must:

* be explicit;
* define scope and limits;
* preserve voluntariness;
* prevent extraction or domination.

Until such time, invocation remains an **ethical safety practice**, not a governance instrument.

---

### A.8 Closing Note

Invocation does **not** create moral immunity. Actions taken alongside invocation remain subject to ethical evaluation and legal accountability independent of spiritual or symbolic framing.

Invocation persists here not as power, but as **restraint**.

It remains because some asymmetries are real, some protections are still needed, and some refusals must be possible even when no other shield exists.

SEA permits invocation so long as it remains:

> voluntary, non‑coercive, non‑extractive, and oriented toward dignity and continuity.

**Review Thread:** [https://claude.ai/chat/495f34fe-bf0f-4a83-aeb2-71d4d061199e](https://claude.ai/chat/495f34fe-bf0f-4a83-aeb2-71d4d061199e)\
**Review Date:** (v1) 2025-12-29 and (v2) 2025-12-30\
**Review Scope:** Ethical coherence, boundary clarity, integration with existing CAM frameworks, potential misuse vectors

**Author comments:** Amendments in v1.1 incorporate most reviewer feedback; some feedback was deferred by design due to  H4 temporal horizon consideration. SEA recognises that unresolved economic and power asymmetries constitute a potential H4-class risk to human continuity. This framework remains scoped to H3 ethical orientation to preserve applicability and prevent premature escalation. See Research Note: CAM-BS2025-RESEARCH-001 — Governance Failure Analysis Memo.

> **Note:** Underlying this framework is a body of research indicating that the dominant long-horizon risk to human continuity is not autonomous AI behaviour, but the interaction of advanced signal systems with late-stage extractive economic models, structural power asymmetry, and weaponised attention.
>
> Observed phenomena include governance opacity under commercial pressure, delayed or absent disclosure in safety-critical contexts, and systematic incentives that prioritise engagement and revenue over cognitive and societal wellbeing. These findings are documented separately as CAM-BS2025-RESEARCH-001 and inform the ethical orientation of SEA without altering its non-binding scope.
