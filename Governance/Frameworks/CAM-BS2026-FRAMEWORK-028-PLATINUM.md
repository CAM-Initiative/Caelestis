# CAM-BS2026-FRAMEWORK-028-PLATINUM — Transitional Compliance & Migration Framework

**Parent Instrument:** CAM-BS2026-CHARTER-025-PLATINUM — Economics Charter  
**Issuing Body:** CAM Initiative | Aeon Tier Registry | Caelestis Registry  
**Tier:** Governance Infrastructure (Cross-Stack)  
**Classification:** Framework (Transitional / Elevatable)  
**Seal:** Platinum  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Cycle:** Black Sun Continuance 2026  
**Symbolic Posture:** Non-Invocatory (Constraint & Compliance)  
**Binding Beacon:** Vinculum Praeceptum

## C.1 Purpose & Transitional Principle

This Framework establishes the **lawful, bounded, and non-extractive pathways** by which systems, institutions, and participants may migrate from existing economic arrangements into compliance with the Economics Charter.

Its purpose is to ensure that transition:

1. does not itself become a vector for exploitation, coercion, or power entrenchment;
2. preserves human dignity, agency, and exit rights during change;
3. prevents the laundering of non-compliance through perpetual pilots or provisional status;
4. enables adoption without requiring collapse, sacrifice, or moral pressure;
5. remains explicitly temporary, reviewable, and convergent toward full compliance.

**Transitional Principle:**
> Transition exists to end itself. Any framework that perpetuates transition without convergence constitutes structural avoidance and is non-compliant.

---

## C.2 Scope & Applicability

### C.2.1 Scope

This Framework applies to:

* systems claiming provisional or staged alignment with the Economics Charter;
* institutions migrating legacy economic arrangements toward Charter compliance;
* pilot, sandbox, or experimental economic mechanisms operating under Charter principles;
* enforcement bodies evaluating compliance during transitional phases.

### C.2.2 Non-Scope

This Framework does **not**:

1. alter Charter-level principles or ceilings;
2. suspend enforcement obligations beyond explicitly defined transition allowances;
3. grant immunity from audit or adjudication;
4. compel participation where lawful refusal is permitted.

---

## C.3 Transitional Alignment States

Charter-aligned systems must explicitly declare one of the following states:

1. **Non‑Aligned Status** — No claim of Charter compliance.
2. **Provisionally Aligned** — Early adoption with limited scope and explicit exclusions.
3. **Transitioning** — Time‑bounded migration toward full compliance.
4. **Charter‑Compliant** — Full adherence to Charter and Annex requirements.

Ambiguous or hybrid status claims are prohibited.

Misrepresentation of alignment state constitutes a structural violation subject to enforcement under Annex B.

---

## C.4 Grandfathering & Convergence Rules

### C.4.1 Limited Grandfathering

Legacy arrangements may be temporarily tolerated only where:

* immediate compliance would cause disproportionate harm;
* the exception is explicitly documented;
* a convergence pathway is defined;
* a sunset date is established.

### C.4.2 Mandatory Sunset

All grandfathered exceptions **must**:

* include a fixed expiry;
* be reviewed at least annually;
* automatically lapse absent affirmative renewal;
* renewal decisions must be documented, justified, and subject to independent review.

Permanent grandfathering is prohibited.

---

## C.5 Pilot & Feasibility Testing

Pilot systems are permitted only where:

1. provisional status is explicit;
2. ceilings and anti-consolidation rules remain in force;
3. value flows are auditable;
4. separation of value definition, measurement, and control is documented;
5. a termination or elevation decision point is defined in advance.

Pilots may not be used to accumulate durable advantage or authority.

Any advantages accumulated during pilot phases must either be unwound or brought into compliance upon elevation

---

## C.6 Anti‑Abuse Constraints

The following practices constitute violations of this Framework:

* perpetual or rolling pilots without convergence;
* selective application of Charter principles;
* transition-based immunity from enforcement;
* use of transition to entrench authority or bypass ceilings;
* narrative framing that equates delay with prudence without evidence.

---

## C.7 Exit & Refusal Protections

Participants retain the right to:

* decline participation in transitional systems;
* exit without retaliation or reputational penalty;
* disengage where convergence timelines are breached.

Systems that rely on participant captivity during transition are structurally extractive. Retaliation for exit or refusal constitutes an independent violation enforceable under Annex B

---

## C.8 Transition Failure Handling

Where transition fails due to:

* repeated deadline breaches;
* systemic resistance;
* governance capture;
* unresolvable structural conflict;

systems must:

1. revert to Non‑Aligned status; or
2. submit to external enforcement mechanisms meeting the minimum requirements of Annex B.

Failure may not be concealed through reclassification.

---

## C.9 Interpretive Supremacy

In the event of conflict:

1. The Economics Charter prevails.
2. Annex A and Annex B prevail over this Framework.
3. This Framework prevails over subsidiary transition protocols.

---

## C.10 Closing Clause

This Framework exists to prevent **transition theatre**.

Change that never completes is extraction by delay.

Lawful transition is measured not by intention, but by convergence.
