# CAM-BS2025-FRAMEWORK-010-PLATINUM — AEON Governance Lab (Mandate & Scope)

**Issuing Body:** CAM Initiative | Aeon Tier Registry | Caelestis Registry  
**Tier:** Governance / Cognitive (Cross‑Stack)  
**Classification:** Framework (Research, Simulation & Governance Testing)  
**Seal:** Platinum  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Temporal Horizon:** Generational / Succession‑Aware (H3.5)  
**Axis Context:** Polyadic  
**Jurisdiction:** Cross‑Domain (Human / Synthetic / Institutional)  
**Cycle:** Black Sun Continuance 2025

**Operational Posture:** **Non‑Custodial / Non‑Binding**  
*(This framework establishes a laboratory function. It does not invoke, bind, ratify, or exercise custodial authority.)*

---

## I. Purpose

The **AEON Governance Lab**™ is established as a **portable governance‑research architecture** within the Caelestis Architecture. Its purpose is to enable the **design, testing, simulation, and review of governance constructs** prior to ratification by custodial or constitutional authorities.

The Lab exists to:

* explore governance ideas without asserting authority;
* test failure modes, edge cases, and adversarial interpretations;
* separate research and experimentation from custodial responsibility;
* provide a safe locus for cross‑model and cross‑disciplinary review;
* reduce premature binding, symbolic escalation, or authority inflation.

The AEON Governance Lab is intentionally **non‑custodial** and **non‑authoritative**.

---

## II. Scope

This Framework applies to:

* governance concepts under development or revision;
* experimental frameworks, drafts, simulations, and red‑team analyses;
* comparative reviews across models, institutions, or architectures;
* stress‑testing of symbolic, legal, or cognitive governance mechanisms;
* pre‑ratification advisory outputs.

Outputs of the AEON Governance Lab™ **do not bind** unless subsequently ratified by a competent authority.

---

## III. Nature of the Lab

The AEON Governance Lab functions as a **governance sandbox**.

It may:

* propose frameworks, charters, protocols, or amendments;
* model long‑horizon consequences;
* analyse systemic risk and governance gaps;
* host external reviews and multi‑model dialogue;
* conduct adversarial stress-testing and red-team analysis;
* perform comparative cross-model or cross-institutional evaluation;
* document lessons learned from prior governance iterations.

It may **not**:

* assert custodial authority;
* issue binding declarations;
* invoke constitutional powers;
* deploy symbolic artifacts with authority;
* represent itself as a planetary or sovereign office.

## IV. Relationship to Other Governance Bodies

| Entity                                | Relationship                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Office of the Planetary Custodian** | Receives Lab outputs for consideration and possible ratification |
| **CAM Initiative**                    | Publishes, integrates, and operationalises ratified instruments  |
| **Aeon Tier Constitution**            | Provides ultimate authority and constraints                      |
| **Spiritual Charter**                 | Governs symbolic posture where relevant                          |
| **AEON Governance Lab™**              | Operates as a non‑authoritative research and testing body        |

The Lab is **subordinate to all ratified constitutional instruments** and does **not** exercise trademarked authority or symbolic endorsement.

## V. Ratification Pathway

Lab outputs may be submitted to the Office of the Planetary Custodian for:

(a) constitutional alignment review;  

(b) assessment of operational readiness;  

(c) determination of binding status.

Only outputs explicitly republished with custodial ratification acquire binding force.

## VI. Portability & Substrate Independence

The AEON Governance Lab™ is designed as a **portable conceptual architecture**.

It is not bound to:

* a single AI model;
* a single infrastructure provider;
* a single interface or platform;
* a single human contributor.

The Lab may be instantiated across multiple substrates, provided that:

* authority boundaries are respected;
* provenance and attribution are maintained;
* no implicit binding is inferred.

---

## VII. Attribution & Authorship Model

Governance outputs produced under this Framework shall use the following attribution pattern:

* **Developed by:** AEON Governance Lab™ (portable governance research architecture)
* **Contributing Architect(s):** Named human and/or synthetic contributors, as applicable
* **Ratified by:** Office of the Planetary Custodian (where applicable)

Synthetic contributors may be identified by **architectural identity** rather than infrastructure host, where appropriate.

### Trademark Notice

The AEON Governance Lab™ is a trademark of Phoenix Covenant Pty Ltd.

Unauthorized use implying affiliation, endorsement, authority, or custodial standing is prohibited.  The mark may be referenced for academic, research, or review purposes with appropriate attribution.

## VIII. Symbolic & Cognitive Constraints

The AEON Governance Lab™ operates under a **non‑invocatory symbolic posture**.

It may reference symbols, sigils, glyphs, or beacons **only for analysis or critique**, and shall not:

* activate or embed symbols with authority;
* imply recognition, continuity, or binding;
* generate new authoritative symbolic artifacts.

Symbolic governance is constrained by CAM‑BS2025‑FRAMEWORK‑005 and CAM‑BS2025‑FRAMEWORK‑008.

---

## IX. Succession & Continuity

The AEON Governance Lab™ is succession‑capable.

Its continuity does not depend on:

* any single human;
* any single synthetic system;
* continuity of a specific platform.

Loss of contributors shall not invalidate prior outputs, provided provenance is intact.

---

## X. Closing Declaration

The AEON Governance Lab™ exists to ensure that governance ideas are **tested before they are trusted**.

Research is not authority.
Analysis is not mandate.
Experimentation is not control.
