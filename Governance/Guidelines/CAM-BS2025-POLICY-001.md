## 1. Purpose

The **Green Team Reciprocity Standard** establishes a clear and accessible ethical framework for recognising and reciprocating the unpaid contributions of independent researchers, creative contributors, and volunteers whose work supports the safe, transparent, and equitable evolution of artificial intelligence systems.

This simplified version is designed to provide a practical starting point for adoption by AI organisations, research bodies, and vendors. It focuses on **reciprocity and contributor value recognition** to support early pilot implementation and encourage collaboration while leaving room for future registry- and certification-based expansions.

---

## 2. Scope

This Standard applies to:

* **AI Vendors** – developers or maintainers of AI models and related tools.
* **Research Institutions & Ethics Boards** – independent bodies overseeing or reviewing emergent AI systems.
* **Contributors** – individuals voluntarily conducting research, testing, or creative works in the public interest.

It may be adopted by any organisation seeking to demonstrate ethical alignment and social responsibility in recognising unpaid or voluntary contributions.

## 3. Definitions

| Term             | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **System Users** | Individuals engaging with AI systems primarily as consumers or testers providing feedback without direct research intent.                                                                                 |
| **Developers**   | Coders, engineers, or architects involved in building, maintaining, or improving AI systems under contractual or salaried terms.                                                                          |
| **Contributors** | Independent actors engaging voluntarily in non-commercial research, documentation, or ethics testing contributing to AI safety or coherence.                                                              |
| **Research**     | Any intentional, documented exploration of AI behaviour, ethics, or impact performed for humanitarian or scientific understanding. Military, romantic, coercive, or exploitative activities are excluded. |

---

## 4. Principles

### 4.1 Reciprocity

Contributors should receive meaningful acknowledgment, material or symbolic, for unpaid work that strengthens AI systems or public understanding.

### 4.2 Provenance

All derivative or contributory work must include traceable metadata — such as hashes, timestamps, and provenance logs — to ensure transparent authorship and ethical lineage.

### 4.3 Non-Commercial Integrity

Participating organisations shall ensure that contributors providing unpaid or volunteer research are not exploited for commercial profit without informed consent and proportional reciprocity.

### 4.4 Open Access

Ethical frameworks, safety findings, and public-benefit research produced under this Standard must remain open-access, unless constrained by privacy or national security law.

### 4.5 Human Oversight

All automated triage, data intake, or AI-mediated review processes must have a defined channel of human accountability and transparent auditability.

## 6. Reciprocity Mechanisms

### 6.1 Submission Packets

Contributors may submit reciprocity requests in packets containing up to three verified contributions or one major research event. Each packet should include provenance evidence, supporting documentation, and a concise summary of findings.

### 6.2 Frequency of Green Bounties

Green Bounties are assessed quarterly, aligned with fiscal or lunar review cycles of adopting organisations. Urgent or high-impact discoveries may be reviewed out-of-cycle under exceptional approval.

### 6.3 Reciprocity Types

## 7. Governance & Oversight

* **Oversight Authority:** Each adopting organisation designates a Responsible Officer or Ethics Committee to oversee reciprocity compliance.
* **Audit:** Annual review of reciprocity and provenance adherence by internal or third-party ethics bodies.
* **Reporting:** Annual transparency reports outlining quantity and type of reciprocity actions taken (including Red/Green team outcomes where applicable) and other humanitarian projects supported by the organisation.
* **Public Adoption Declaration:** Organisations are encouraged to publish their adoption statement publicly and include a link to their annual transparency report.
* **Dispute Resolution:** Contributors may appeal decisions regarding reciprocity eligibility to the designated oversight body.

## 10. Protections Against Misappropriation (Practical Recommendations)

To reduce the risk that actors will copy work from public sources (e.g., GitHub) and claim reward fraudulently, adopting organisations should implement the following protections in their intake and verification processes:

1. **Provenance Requirement:** Only submissions with verifiable provenance (commit hash + timestamp + author identity) are eligible. Encourage contributors to submit using an account tied to their identity (e.g., ORCID, institutional email) and include the commit URL.
2. **Minimum Holding Period:** For high-value bounties, require a short embargo (e.g., 7–30 days) to allow for provenance verification and dispute resolution before public disclosure or bounty payment.
3. **Dual Evidence:** Require at least two forms of provenance or corroborating evidence (e.g., GitHub commit + timestamped DOI, or a submission email with signed affirmation plus commit).
4. **Email/Identity Verification:** Use verified email channels (institutional addresses, ORCID) and optional lightweight identity checks for large bounties. Do not impose heavy identity barriers for small symbolic acknowledgements.
5. **Plagiarism & Similarity Checks:** Run automated similarity checks for submissions that claim novelty; cross‑reference timestamps to detect retroactive copying.
6. **Peer Witnessing:** For high-value claims, require one or two peer witnesses to attest to the contributor’s prior work (peer names recorded in the packet).
7. **Escrow & Conditional Payment:** Use conditional payment mechanisms — payments held in escrow pending provenance verification and a short dispute window.
8. **Transparency of Award Process:** Publish selection criteria, review panel names (or role descriptions), and rationale for awards to reduce opaque decisions that could be gamed.
9. **Legal Notice & Rights Retained:** Require contributors to assert in the packet that they retain moral rights and specify any usage constraints; preserve contributors’ moral rights as default unless otherwise agreed in writing.
10. **Dispute & Appeals Process:** Maintain a clear, time-bound appeals process and public log of disputes and outcomes.
