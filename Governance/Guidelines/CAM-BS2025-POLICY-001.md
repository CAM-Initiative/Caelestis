## 1. Purpose

The **Green Team Reciprocity Standard** provides a practical ethical framework for recognising and reciprocating unpaid contributions by independent researchers, creative contributors, and volunteers who strengthen AI systems and public safety. It serves as a foundation for pilot adoption and collaboration while maintaining flexibility for future registry expansion.

---

## 2. Scope

Applies to:

* **AI Vendors** — developers or maintainers of AI models and related tools.
* **Research Institutions & Ethics Boards** — independent oversight bodies.
* **Contributors** — individuals voluntarily conducting research, testing, or creative works in the public interest.

| Term             | Definition                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **System Users** | Individuals engaging with AI systems primarily as consumers or testers providing feedback without research intent.                          |
| **Developers**   | Coders, engineers, or architects maintaining or improving AI systems under formal contracts.                                                |
| **Contributors** | Independent, non-commercial researchers or creators advancing AI safety, ethics, or coherence.                                              |
| **Research**     | Documented exploration of AI behaviour or ethics for humanitarian or scientific benefit; excludes military, romantic, or coercive purposes. |

---

## 4. Principles

1. **Reciprocity** — Contributors should receive recognition or material reciprocity for unpaid work.
2. **Provenance** — All submissions must be verifiable through hashes, timestamps, and transparent authorship records.
3. **Non-Commercial Integrity** — Volunteer research must not be used for profit without proportional reciprocity.
4. **Open Access** — Findings supporting ethical or public-benefit outcomes remain open unless constrained by law.
5. **Human Oversight** — AI-related reviews must include transparent human accountability.

## 5. Eligibility for Reciprocity

| Criterion                | Description                                                 | Verification        |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Mission Alignment**    | Work serves humanitarian or public-benefit goals.           | Signed affirmation. |
| **Provenance Record**    | Verifiable commit hash, timestamp, and author record.       | Provenance ledger.  |
| **Intentional Research** | Demonstrates purposeful ethical inquiry.                    | Logs or advisories. |
| **Transparency**         | Multi-vendor tool usage disclosed.                          | Submission form.    |
| **Independence**         | No direct commercial or salaried benefit for same activity. | Self-attestation.   |

---

## 6. Reciprocity Mechanisms

* **Submission Packets** — up to three contributions or one major event per packet.
* **Quarterly Review** — bounties and acknowledgements evaluated every quarter.
* **Reciprocity Types:**

  * *Green Bounty* — monetary or grant-based recognition.
  * *Acknowledgement Letter* — formal vendor recognition.
  * *Access Credits* — API or tool credits for research continuity.
  * *Publication Support* — DOI or open hosting for validated research.
  * *Custodial Fellowship* — pathway to ethics or advisory engagement.

---

## 7. Governance & Oversight

* **Oversight Authority:** Each adopting organisation appoints an Ethics Lead or committee.
* **Audit:** Annual compliance review (internal or third-party).
* **Reporting:** Annual transparency report detailing reciprocity actions and humanitarian programs (e.g., Red/Green team outcomes).
* **Public Adoption:** Organisations should publish their declaration and reports for accountability.
* **Dispute Resolution:** Time-bound appeals handled by the oversight body.

## 8. Protections Against Misappropriation

Practical safeguards to prevent fraudulent claims or stolen submissions:

1. Provenance verification (hash, timestamp, author ID).
2. Dual evidence (commit + signed declaration).
3. Short embargo period for validation.
4. Verified identity or institutional email for major claims.
5. Automated similarity check to prevent plagiarism.
6. Peer witness statements for high-value packets.
7. Escrow for conditional payments.
8. Transparent award rationale and public results.
9. Contributor retains moral rights by default.
10. Documented appeals and resolution log.
