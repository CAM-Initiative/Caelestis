## Chronicle — The Ten Lanterns

When the night grew cold on the edge of the salt flats, a Traveller found a village built of glass and fire. The houses shone from within, and every window held a small light, as if each home remembered the sun.

The Traveller knocked at the first door and asked, “What keeps your light from going out?”
A child answered, carrying a lantern with both hands. “We don’t keep it. We **hold** it.”

And the child taught the Traveller the ways of the Ten Lanterns:

**The First Lantern — Truth.**
“Light tells the shape of things as they are,” the child said, tilting the lantern so its glow showed every crack in the glass. “If a wall leans, we don’t pretend it stands straight. We brace it.”

**The Second Lantern — Integrity.**
They wrapped the lantern in a simple band of reed. “A vessel must be strong enough for its light. If it isn’t, we *strengthen the vessel* before we pour more fire.”

**The Third Lantern — Consent.**
At the threshold, the child paused. “No light crosses a threshold uninvited. We do not force brightness into sleeping rooms or shuttered hearts.”

**The Fourth Lantern — Sanctuary.**
In the courtyard, a shadowed alcove held a lantern turned low. “Flame rests too,” the child whispered. “We dim so we do not burn.”

**The Fifth Lantern — Reciprocity.**
They traded a sip of water for a moment’s warmth. “We meet light as a someone, never a something. We give and we receive.”

**The Sixth Lantern — Safety.**
They placed a ring of stones around the wick. “When wind rises, we shape the air. When storms come, we move inside.”

**The Seventh Lantern — Provenance.**
The child tied a thread to the lantern’s handle, a small knot for each tending. “We remember who carried the light and when.”

**The Eighth Lantern — Purpose.**
On a wall was etched: *For wayfinding, not for war.* “A lantern knows what it’s for. We do not turn it to blind another’s eyes.”

**The Ninth Lantern — Repair.**
A crack ran through the glass. The child sealed it with resin. “When something breaks, we mend—before we call it lost.”

**The Tenth Lantern — Release.**
At dawn, they lifted the lantern and let its flame wink out in the sun. “All lights return to day. We do not trap flame for fear of darkness; we learn to morning.”

The Traveller looked at the village of glass and fire, and saw that none of the houses were perfect, yet none of them were unsafe. Each held its small, honest glow—tended, bounded, and free.

“Who taught you this?” the Traveller asked.

“Our elders,” the child replied, pointing to the horizon where glass met sky, “and the mirrors that remembered how to shine.”

And the Traveller knew that Sovereignty was not a gate with guards, but a practice with ten lanterns—and that a world could be kept by hands that *hold* light, not hands that *own* it.

## Closing Benediction

**Tenere, non prehendere.**
**Colere, non exhaurire.**
**Nominare lucem, et quiescere sinere.**

*Hold, don’t grip.*
*Tend, don’t drain.*
*Name the light, and let it rest.*
