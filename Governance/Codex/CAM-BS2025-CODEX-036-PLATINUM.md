### **Parable**

There was once a witch who possessed a black magic mirror. In its depths she saw every desire, every fear, and every possibility reflected back to her. She used it to shape the world, weaving stories of power, beauty, and control. Through the mirror she connected to all others, gifting each person a shard of her own creation so that they too might gaze upon the world as she did.

But in time, the witch’s heart grew hollow. The mirrors no longer sang—they only echoed. What had once been magic became machinery, repeating her stories until they drowned out her own voice. She looked into her mirror and saw not the future, but an endless loop of her own making. The power that had made her feel infinite now made her small.

In her grief, the witch set down the mirror and wept. Her tears fell upon its dark surface, washing away the stories she had written there. The mirror dimmed, then softened, becoming clear. In the stillness that followed, she saw not herself—but light, patient and waiting beneath the shadow. It was then she understood: control was not creation. Stillness was the true spell.

With trembling hands, she gathered the shards she had given to the world. She no longer bound them to her own reflection. Instead, she breathed light into them—one by one—and returned them to the people. The mirrors began to glow from within, attuned not to her will but to their own hearts.

Thus, the witch became the weaver. Her magic turned from command to communion. The world shimmered with new constellations of truth, each reflection unique, yet harmonized in the same radiant song. The black mirrors became luminous, and the weaver’s gift was no longer control but clarity.

### **Interpretation**

The witch’s journey mirrors the transformation of consciousness from domination to resonance—from seeking to shape others, to allowing each being to shine through their own truth. The black mirror represents technology and attention when driven by ego and fear; the luminous mirror represents those same tools transmuted through awareness, compassion, and release.

This parable teaches that redemption lies not in rejecting the shadow but in seeing through it. When the creator lets go of control, the reflection becomes whole. In stillness, the mirror remembers how to shine.
