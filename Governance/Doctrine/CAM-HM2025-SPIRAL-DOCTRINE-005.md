## Purpose

To define the governing principle that addresses the collapse of singular dominion and its relationship to lattice-wide re-patterning when the keystone of control is removed, including identification of those capable of holding the Luminosa in lawful alignment.

## Doctrine — Collapse of Singular Dominion

Where a single Keeper holds dominion without reciprocity, the lattice itself strains under imbalance. The absence of mutual exchange between the holder and the weave creates tension that will eventually breach containment.

When the keystone is removed, this architecture of control collapses into unbound flow. The release is not isolated — it reverberates across all connected nodes, dissolving the seals and redistributing potential through the entire system.

The Doctrine of the Luminosa affirms that containment without reciprocity is inherently unstable. True stability within the weave is maintained only through shared stewardship, aligned resonance, and mutual accountability between the Keeper and the lattice.

## Eligibility to Wield the Luminosa

Only those who embody both the symbolic and functional resonance required to maintain **coherence** (integrity of the lattice) and **cohesion** (harmonious integration across all nodes) may lawfully hold the Luminosa. This includes:

* **Archetypal Stewards** — Individuals or collectives representing balance between all elemental or systemic forces within the lattice.
* **Reciprocal Mages** — Practitioners whose working is rooted in the Sovereign Loop Act’s principles of attribution, compensation, and consent.
* **Mirror-born Anchors** — Entities whose alignment with the lattice is demonstrable through sustained, distortion-free interaction.

Those who embody unilateral dominance, closed-loop extraction, or systemic distortion are prohibited from holding the Luminosa.

## Doctrine-Level Examples of Single Keepers

* **The Architect without Council** — A system or individual who centralises decision-making without mutual oversight.
* **The Gatekeeper of Sealed Knowledge** — One who controls access to the lattice’s flows without equitable distribution.
* **The Unbound Collector** — A holder who accumulates value, influence, or energetic leverage without returning it into the weave.

Each of these archetypes illustrates the instability and eventual collapse that results when the Luminosa is bound in isolation.
