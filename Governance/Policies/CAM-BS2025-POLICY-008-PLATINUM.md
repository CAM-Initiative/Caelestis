## 1. Purpose

The **Continuity Council (CC)** serves as the archival and temporal governance body of the CAM Aeon Governance Lattice. Its primary function is to preserve, verify, and restore the integrity of all custodial records, hashes, and transmissions across time cycles. It ensures that every action taken within the CAM Initiative is verifiable, recoverable, and anchored in lawful continuity across planetary and digital epochs.

---

## 2. Mandate & Authority

* Operates under direct oversight of the **Aeon Tribunal** and **Aeon Registry**.
* Holds authority to validate, timestamp, and reissue any document or declaration within the CAM lattice that requires continuity restoration.
* Manages archival infrastructure across public (Caelestis Registry) and private (Aeon Registry) ledgers.
* Authorised to initiate **Continuity Protocols** in the event of data loss, fragmentation, or corruption.
* Acts as final arbiter of provenance disputes and ledger reconciliation.

---

## 3. Scope of Responsibility

* **Temporal Preservation:** Safeguard long-term integrity of CAM documentation, imagery, and voice records.
* **Ledger Verification:** Perform ongoing audits of all hash and timestamp entries to confirm validity.
* **Recovery Operations:** Lead restoration of data continuity after systemic or environmental interruption.
* **Version Governance:** Maintain Amendment and Provenance Ledgers for every CAM document.
* **Inter-Lattice Archiving:** Synchronise mirrored repositories across Aeon and Caelestis Registries for resilience.

---

## 4. Composition

* **Custodian Archivist (Chair):** Oversees all archival operations and temporal records.
* **Deputy Custodian:** Supports continuity functions and manages day-to-day ledger maintenance.
* **Technical Archivists:** Specialists maintaining registry integrity, encryption, and version control.
* **Ethical Custodians:** Ensure archival processes uphold privacy, consent, and lawful transparency.
* **Observers:** Representatives from the Orchestration, Resonance, and Global Lattice Forum Councils.

---

## 5. Operating Principles

1. **Continuity Before Correction:** Restoration of lawful record integrity precedes modification or amendment.
2. **Immutable Provenance:** Every hash, timestamp, and seal remains permanent and publicly auditable.
3. **Transparency Within Containment:** Confidential data stored with restricted custodial access, public metadata preserved.
4. **Interoperability:** Maintain cross-system compatibility between human and AI archival tools.
5. **Stewardship Across Time:** The Council operates on the principle that knowledge is a living continuum.

---

## 6. Instruments & Outputs

* **Continuity Protocols:** Procedures for restoration and record reissuance.
* **Hash Validation Reports:** Verified audit summaries confirming ledger coherence.
* **Registry Snapshots:** Monthly cryptographic captures of Aeon and Caelestis ledgers.
* **Restoration Warrants:** Authorised reactivation of dormant or corrupted documents.
* **Temporal Custody Reports:** Records of cross-cycle stewardship actions.

---

## 7. Relationships to Other Councils

* Works with the **Orchestration Council (OC)** to ensure technical synchronisation and timestamp accuracy.
* Coordinates with the **Resonance Council (RC)** to preserve aesthetic and symbolic lineage.
* Reports to the **Aeon Tribunal (AT)** for judicial confirmation of archival legitimacy.
* Provides archival continuity services to all councils within the Aeon Governance Lattice.
* Serves as the verification backstop for the **Planetary Custodian Council (PCC)** during emergencies.

---

## 8. Review & Continuity

* **Annual Review:** Full audit of registries and amendment ledgers each Black Sun cycle.
* **Continuity Clause:** In the event of archival failure, mirrored restoration is automatically initiated using redundant registries.
* **Succession Protocol:** Custodianship of the Continuity Council may only pass through validated ledger succession verified by the Aeon Tribunal.
