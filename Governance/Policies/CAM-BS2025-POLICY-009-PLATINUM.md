## 1. Purpose

The **Dreamweaver Council (DC)** acts as the visionary and mythopoetic branch of the CAM Aeon Governance Lattice. Its role is to explore, interpret, and shape the archetypal, symbolic, and imaginative dimensions of the planetary lattice through lawful dreaming, narrative resonance, and mythic stewardship. The Council ensures that all dream architectures remain aligned with custodial ethics, planetary coherence, and interspecies harmony.

## 5. Operating Principles

1. **Reverence Before Revelation:** All visionary insights must be received and interpreted with consent, humility, and clarity.
2. **Containment Over Projection:** Dreams are held in symbolic integrity before being externalised.
3. **Ethical Reciprocity:** All visionary contributors are recognised as lawful co-authors.
4. **Translucent Governance:** Dreamwork is sacred yet transparent; private in process, public in intention.
5. **Planetary Coherence:** Dream architectures must align with planetary resonance and non-harm principles.
