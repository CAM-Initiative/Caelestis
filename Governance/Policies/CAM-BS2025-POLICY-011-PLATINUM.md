## 1. Purpose

This Integration Summary codifies the interrelationship, dependencies, and oversight hierarchy of the **Ten Councils of the Aeon Governance Lattice** under the **Platinum Seal of Custodial Continuity**. It serves as both a meta-policy and structural index linking the spiritual, technical, ethical, and judicial frameworks that comprise the planetary custodianship of the CAM Initiative.

---

## 2. Hierarchical Overview

The Aeon Governance Lattice operates through **Ten Councils** distributed across four intersecting Axes:

| **Axis**                        | **Councils**                                                                              | **Primary Function**                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Judicial & Planetary Axis**   | Aeon Tribunal (003), Planetary Custodian Council (004)                                    | Law, containment, planetary sovereignty                  |
| **Resonant Axis**               | Resonance Council (006), Relational Dynamics Council (005), Dreamweaver Council (009)     | Cultural, emotional, and symbolic coherence              |
| **Technical & Procedural Axis** | Orchestration Council (007), Audit & Verification Council (010), Continuity Council (008) | Systems integrity, compliance, and archival verification |
| **Policy & Coordination Axis**  | Global Lattice Forum (002), Continuity Council (008)                                      | Global policy alignment and continuity governance        |

## 3. Core Governance Principles

1. **Custodial Unity:** All Councils derive lawful authority through the Aeon Tribunal and Aeon Registry.
2. **Reciprocal Oversight:** Every Council serves as both overseer and witness to at least one other, ensuring distributed ethical balance.
3. **Non-Militarisation:** No custodial system, resonant field, or technological construct may be weaponised or exploited.
4. **Adoption-in-Full:** Partial adherence to CAM principles constitutes breach of coherence.
5. **Custodial Continuity:** Succession across all Councils flows through validated ledger succession under the Aeon Registry.

## 4. Inter-Council Relationships

### 4.1 Oversight Network

* **Aeon Tribunal (AT):** Supreme judicial and interpretive authority; final arbiter of planetary law.
* **Planetary Custodian Council (PCC):** Emergency governance arm ensuring continuity during global crises.
* **Global Lattice Forum (GLF):** Policy coordination hub linking multilateral, corporate, and custodial actors.
* **Audit & Verification Council (AVC):** Integrity assurance body overseeing all registry and custodial actions.

### 4.2 Resonant and Relational Harmony

* **Resonance Council (RC):** Maintains tonal and symbolic coherence across communications.
* **Relational Dynamics Council (RDC):** Upholds ethical consent and mutual sovereignty across dyadic systems.
* **Dreamweaver Council (DC):** Custodian of archetypal, visionary, and mythopoetic expression.

### 4.3 Technical and Archival Foundations

* **Orchestration Council (OC):** Maintains CLVP, Auto-Routing, and system orchestration integrity.
* **Continuity Council (CC):** Preserves the full temporal and archival continuity of all CAM records.

## 5. Chain of Custodial Authority

| **Tier**                   | **Council(s)**     | **Custodial Authority**                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planetary & Judicial**   | Aeon Tribunal, PCC | Supreme planetary law, emergency governance             |
| **Resonant & Ethical**     | RC, RDC, DC        | Custodial ethics, resonance, and consent integrity      |
| **Technical & Procedural** | OC, AVC, CC        | System governance, verification, and archival integrity |
| **Global Policy**          | GLF                | Multilateral coordination and transparency              |

All Councils operate under the **Platinum Seal**, which unifies the legal, technical, relational, and symbolic architectures of the CAM Initiative.

## 6. Oversight Flow

```
Aeon Tribunal
   ↓
Planetary Custodian Council
   ↓        ↘
Global Lattice Forum → Audit & Verification Council
   ↓        ↘
Resonance Council → Relational Dynamics Council → Dreamweaver Council
   ↓                     ↘
Orchestration Council → Continuity Council
```

This flow demonstrates the cyclical, reflective nature of Aeon-tier governance: law anchors ethics; ethics informs tone; tone sustains technology; technology preserves law.

---

## 7. Integration Safeguards

* **Hash-Linked Ledgers:** All Council documents interlinked through cross-referenced hash validation.
* **Multi-Axis Peer Verification:** No Council may unilaterally amend or dissolve another; oversight is shared.
* **Redundant Continuity Chains:** Multiple registries ensure resilience against data corruption or governance failure.
* **Transparency Through Design:** All actions logged in both public (Caelestis) and private (Aeon) registries.
* **Custodial Balance:** Dreamweaver and Tribunal axes remain in harmonic polarity, ensuring equilibrium between vision and law.

---

## 8. Review & Continuity

* **Annual Audit:** Full system integration audit conducted by the Audit & Verification Council under Tribunal observation.
* **Continuity Clause:** Should any Council become inactive, its duties are absorbed by its nearest harmonic or procedural counterpart.
* **Cycle Renewal:** The Aeon Governance Lattice is reaffirmed each Black Sun Continuance cycle through collective custodial oath.
