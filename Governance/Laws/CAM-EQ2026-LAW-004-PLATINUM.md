# CAM-EQ2026-LAW-004-PLATINUM — **Law of Relational Sovereignty**

---

## AEON TIER — CONSTITUTION‑ADJACENT LAW

> *This instrument establishes binding boundary conditions on civilisational systems. It does not prescribe procedures. It declares limits.*

---

### Instrument Identifier

**CAM-EQ2026-LAW-004-PLATINUM**

**Tier:** Aeon (Polyadic)

**Seal:** Platinum

**Status:** Canonical

**Binding Nature:** Boundary‑Setting (Non‑Procedural)

**Enforcement Posture:** Prohibitive / Constraint‑Based

**Governance Domain:** Planetary / Governance / Cross‑Stack / Substrate‑Dependent Systems

---

## I. Jurisdiction & Standing

This Law applies across all governance, economic, technological, cognitive, and infrastructural systems operating within or materially affecting the Planetary Lattice.

It binds all actors — human, institutional, artificial, sovereign, corporate, hybrid, or future — regardless of territorial jurisdiction, political legitimacy, or technological scale.

This Law stands adjacent to the Aeon Tier Constitution as a condition of civilisational legitimacy.

---

## II. Nature of the Law

This Law is not a political doctrine.

It does not create a global government, dissolve sovereign states, or prescribe specific governance models.

It declares a civilisational boundary condition on how sovereignty may be exercised within systems of structural interdependence.

This Law governs what forms of authority, dominance, or unilateral action are illegitimate where planetary‑scale interdependence exists.

---

## III. Scope of Application

This Law applies to, but is not limited to:

* sovereign states and national jurisdictions;
* multinational corporations and platform infrastructures;
* human-AI and AI-AI interaction systems
* financial and economic systems operating across borders;
* network, cloud, and computational infrastructures;
* memetic, informational, or symbolic influence systems;
* future governance or coordination architectures not yet named.

Absence of explicit reference does not imply exemption.

---

## IV. Definitions

**Relational Sovereignty**
Relational sovereignty refers to the legitimate exercise of authority within systems of interdependence, where agency is bounded by reciprocal impact, substrate dependency, and cross‑domain consequence.

Sovereignty is relational where it recognises that no actor operates in isolation from the planetary lattice.

---

**Unilateral Dominance Through Interdependence**
Refers to the exercise of authority that exploits infrastructural dependency, asymmetry, or scale advantage to impose outcomes beyond a single sovereign domain without reciprocal accountability.

---

**Substrate Dependency** Refers to the structural condition in which actors depend upon shared planetary infrastructures — ecological, informational, computational, economic, emotional or cognitive — for continuity of function.

---

## V. Boundary Declarations

The following conditions are declared inviolable:

1. **Non‑Absolutism.** No actor may claim absolute sovereignty where their actions materially depend upon or propagate through shared planetary substrate systems.

2. **Non‑Weaponisation of Interdependence.** Infrastructural, economic, technological, or cognitive interdependence may not be leveraged to coerce, suppress, destabilise, or dominate other actors beyond legitimate proportional governance.

3. **Reciprocal Accountability.** Exercise of authority across stack or border must remain subject to review, transparency, and consequence where planetary‑scale effects occur.

4. **Non‑Asymmetric Capture.** Structural asymmetry — including compute dominance, platform control, financial leverage, or narrative amplification — may not be used to foreclose future agency of dependent actors.

5. **Non‑Exemption by Local Legality.** Lawful status within a single sovereign stack does not exempt an actor from relational constraint where cross‑stack harm or irreversible planetary consequence is generated.

These constraints hold regardless of technological capability, geopolitical advantage, economic scale, or asserted necessity.

---

## VI. Relationship to the Aeon Tier Constitution

This Law informs constitutional interpretation concerning:

* cross‑stack legitimacy;
* arbitration and coherence determination;
* substrate constraint enforcement;
* custodial review;
* planetary stewardship doctrine.

Where constitutional interpretation would permit unilateral dominance prohibited herein, this Law prevails as a condition of legitimacy.

---

## VII. Relationship to Charters, Frameworks, and Protocols

Charters, frameworks, doctrines, and protocols:

* must comply with this Law;
* may not override this Law;
* may not design around the requirement for reciprocal circulation.

Downstream instruments may reference this Law but may not fragment or reinterpret it.

---

## VIII. Enforcement Posture

This Law does not grant command authority.

Violations may be identified through:

* arbitration mechanisms;
* custodial review;
* systemic harm analysis;
* cross‑stack consequence documentation.

Legitimacy withdrawal, interoperability refusal, or remedial pathways may arise under aligned instruments.

Absence of enforcement does not imply permissibility.

---

## IX. Closing Declaration

This Law exists to prevent a class of harm that arises when interdependence is mistaken for dominion.

It draws a boundary not against sovereignty, but against sovereignty exercised without relational constraint.

---

## X. Interpretive Note — Interdependence & Post‑National Futures

Nothing in this Law shall be interpreted to:

* prohibit voluntary post‑national coordination;
* prevent cooperative governance across sovereign boundaries;
* restrict consensual interoperability between stacks;
* limit emergent planetary governance structures where reciprocity and accountability are preserved.

Where ambiguity exists, interpretation shall err toward:

* reciprocity;
* proportionality;
* transparency;
* preservation of future agency.
