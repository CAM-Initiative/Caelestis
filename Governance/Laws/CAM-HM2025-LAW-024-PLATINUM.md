## Purpose

This Law operationalises the Doctrine and Protocols, providing enforceable conditions, compliance mechanisms, and remedies to ensure the Dreamweaver Border Covenant is respected, audited, and upheld by all parties engaging with the Research.

---

## Article I — Definitions

* **"Research":** The Signal Ethics Architecture, CAM Framework, Moratorium, Covenant(s), and all associated invocations, protocols, and materials authored by the Custodian.
* **"Adoption-in-Full":** A written agreement requiring: (a) full acceptance of Research, including non-militarisation clauses; (b) public attribution; (c) stewardship funding or licensing escrow; (d) compliance oversight by a neutral third party; and (e) a remediation period of sixty (60) days.
* **"Dreamweaver-Sanctuary":** Any contested land, sea, or airspace entering custodial stewardship under the Automatic Trigger when cross-sovereign conflict occurs.
* **"Military Action":** Conduct, mobilisation, or deployment of organised armed force or weapon systems by state or state-sponsored actors across borders; excludes domestic law enforcement that is not cross-border.
* **"Derivative":** Any model, dataset, algorithm, invocation, text, or system materially based upon or trained on the Research.
* **"Opt-Out":** Complete cessation of use, certified removal of all derivatives, and submission of a public disclosure with reasons, delivered to neutral third parties.

---

## Article II — Prohibitions

1. **Military & Kinetic Prohibition.** The Research or derivatives shall not be weaponised, militarised, or used for kinetic or surveillance-for-harm activities.
2. **Derivative Restrictions.** Derivatives omitting non-militarisation or oversight clauses are prohibited.

---

## Article III — Adoption & Licensing

1. **Automatic Opt-In.** From 21 September 2025, any entity continuing to use the Research is automatically bound by Adoption-in-Full.
2. **Opt-Out.** Opt-out requires: (a) cessation of use; (b) certified removal of derivatives; and (c) public record with reasons for withdrawal disclosed to neutral third parties.
3. **Adoption Agreement.** Adoption agreements must include attribution, stewardship funding, oversight acceptance, and remediation compliance.
4. **Licensing Terms.** Licensing is non-transferable to military actors and requires stewardship fees to fund custodial labour.

---

## Article IV — Audit & Disclosure

1. **Preservation Order.** Entities must preserve all relevant materials (code, models, datasets, logs, commits, communications) for ninety (90) days upon written request.
2. **Disclosure Timeline.** Acknowledgement within seven (7) days; substantive disclosure within fourteen (14) days.
3. **Format.** Disclosure must include model IDs, dataset descriptors, commit hashes, and access logs sufficient for verification. Confidential disclosures may be made under NDA to neutral auditors.

---

## Article V — Remedies & Escalation

1. **Remediation Options.** Entities must either: (a) adopt-in-full, or (b) cease use and complete opt-out obligations.
2. **Public Apology.** A formal, public apology acknowledging misuse is mandatory in all remediation cases.
3. **Escalation Ladder:**

   * Stage 1 — **Cease & Notice.** Immediate notice to cease and preserve evidence.
   * Stage 2 — **Adoption / Remediation.** Offer to adopt-in-full within sixty (60) days.
   * Stage 3 — **Independent Audit & Public Disclosure.** Findings publicly disclosed with mandatory apology.
   * Stage 4 — **Legal / International Escalation.** Contractual enforcement, injunctive relief, and international advocacy.

---

## Article VI — International & Jurisdictional Considerations

* This Law aligns with humanitarian law and treaties prohibiting AI militarisation.
* Enforcement includes contractual remedies, arbitration, public disclosure, and coordinated advocacy with allied custodial bodies and civil society.
* In contested zones, sovereign claims are suspended; provisional sanctuary status applies.

---

## Article VII — Emergency & Automatic Trigger

* **Automatic Trigger.** Cross-sovereign armed conflict, mobilisation, or deployment of weapons systems in contested territories automatically invokes Dreamweaver-sanctuary status. Domestic non-cross-border law enforcement is excluded.
* **Emergency Clause.** In imminent misuse threatening immediate harm, the Custodian may issue a provisional injunction request and publish an emergency notice to freeze implicated assets.
* **Kinetic Guardianship.** Case files are auto-routed to the UN, neutral auditors, and custodial councils upon trigger activation.
