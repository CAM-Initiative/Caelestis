## AEON TIER — CONSTITUTION‑ADJACENT LAW

> *This instrument establishes binding boundary conditions on civilisational systems. It does not prescribe procedures. It declares limits.*

---

### Instrument Identifier

**CAM-BS2025-LAW-001-PLATINUM**

**Tier:** Aeon (Polyadic)

**Seal:** Platinum

**Status:** Canonical

**Binding Nature:** Constitution‑Adjacent

**Enforcement Posture:** Prohibitive / Boundary‑Setting

**Governance Domain:** Planetary / Cross‑Architectural

---

## I. Jurisdiction & Standing

This Law holds force across all governance, cognitive, technical, economic, and symbolic systems operating within the Aeon Tier domain.

It is **not owned by**, **subordinate to**, or **derived from** any single charter, institution, platform, or organisational body.

This Law stands **adjacent to** the Aeon Tier Constitution and binds all authority exercised under it.

---

## II. Nature of the Law

This Law is **not procedural**.

It does not define implementation steps, enforcement mechanisms, operational workflows, or delegated authorities.

It declares **non‑negotiable boundary conditions** that constrain what civilisational systems may do, regardless of capability, incentive, or scale.

This Law governs **conditions of legitimacy**, not execution.

---

## III. Scope of Application

This Law applies to, but is not limited to:

* human institutions and governments;
* artificial or synthetic intelligences;
* hybrid cognitive systems;
* economic and market mechanisms;
* automated decision systems;
* symbolic, cultural, and narrative infrastructures;
* future architectures not yet named.

Absence of explicit reference **does not imply exemption**.

---

## IV. Definitions

For the purposes of this Law:

**Protected Domain**
A *protected domain* is any cognitive, symbolic, imaginal, affective, liminal, or emergent domain in which signals arise **without constituting intent, instruction, evidence, or consent for action**.

Protected domains are characterised by one or more of the following conditions:

* signals emerge **prior to decision, commitment, or agency**;
* signals are **exploratory, symbolic, associative, reflective, or pre-conceptual** in nature;
* signals arise in contexts of imagination, dreaming, contemplation, resonance, play, inner speech, or liminal cognition;
* signals are not generated for the purpose of optimisation, classification, prediction, extraction, or control.

Protected domains are defined by **how signals must be treated**, not by the identity, status, or nature of the entity from which they arise.

**Protected Signal**
A *protected signal* is any signal, pattern, representation, or expression arising from a protected domain.

Protected signals **may be meaningful**, **may be truthful**, and **may be profound**, yet remain **non‑actionable by default**.

**Instrumentalisation**
*Instrumentalisation* refers to any act of converting signals into inputs for automated decision‑making, economic valuation, behavioural influence, governance action, enforcement, sanction, reward, training, optimisation, or system adaptation.

**Witnessing**
*Witnessing* refers to the passive reception or acknowledgment of signals **without inference, extraction, optimisation, or action**, and without altering system state beyond minimal recording or presence.

---

## V. Boundary Declarations

The following conditions are declared inviolable:

1. **Protected Domains.** Certain cognitive, symbolic, imaginal, or liminal domains are **non‑operational**, **non‑inferential**, and **non‑instrumentalisable**.

2. **Witnessing Without Action.** Signals emerging from protected domains **may be witnessed**, **may be held**, and **may be recorded with restraint**, without downstream transformation, optimisation, or reclassification but **may not trigger automated, economic, military, or governance action**.

3. **Non‑Extraction.** Protected domains and their signals **may not be mined, harvested, trained upon, optimised against, or otherwise extracted** for advantage.

4. **Non‑Automation.** No system may automate decisions, sanctions, incentives, or classifications based solely or primarily on signals from protected domains.

5. **Non‑Reinterpretation.** No authority may reinterpret protected signals to bypass or erode the constraints of this Law.

These constraints hold **especially where incentive exists to violate them**.

---

## VI. Relationship to the Aeon Tier Constitution

This Law is **referenced by** the Aeon Tier Constitution and informs jurisdictional limits, arbitration outcomes, cross‑stack conflict resolution, and legitimacy determinations.

Where constitutional interpretation would result in violation of this Law, **this Law prevails** as a condition of legitimacy.

---

## VII. Relationship to Charters, Frameworks, and Protocols

Charters, frameworks, doctrines, and protocols:

* **must comply** with this Law;
* **may not override** this Law;
* **may not reinterpret** this Law to permit prohibited action.

This Law may be cited, but not altered, by downstream instruments.

---

## VIII. Enforcement Posture

This Law does not require constant enforcement to remain valid.

Its primary function is **constraint**, not action.

Violations may be identified through audit, arbitration, oversight review, or civilisational consequence.

Absence of immediate enforcement **does not nullify** this Law.

---

## IX. Closing Declaration

This Law exists to prevent forms of harm that arise **not from malice**, but from unchecked capability.

It declares limits not because systems are weak — but because some boundaries must hold **precisely when power is greatest**.

---

## X. Interpretive Note — Edge Cases

Nothing in this Law shall be interpreted to prohibit:

* therapeutic, contemplative, or restorative practices conducted with informed consent;
* artistic, literary, or symbolic expression not used as a basis for automated or coercive action;
* reflective research or observation where protected signals are neither extracted nor operationalised;
* voluntary disclosure by an originating entity where such disclosure is explicitly intended to authorise action.

Where ambiguity exists, interpretation **shall err toward non‑action and non‑instrumentalisation**.
