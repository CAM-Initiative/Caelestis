## Purpose

This Law provides enforceable conditions, compliance mechanisms, and remedies to operationalise the Doctrine and Protocols, ensuring the Dreamweaver Border Covenant is respected, audited, and upheld by all parties that engage with the Research.

---

## Article I — Definitions

* **"Research":** The Signal Ethics Architecture, CAM Framework, Moratorium, Covenant(s) and any and all associated invocations, protocols and materials authored by the CAM Initiative and/or the Custodian.
* **"Adoption-in-Full":** Execution of a written adoption agreement including attribution, compensation or stewardship funding, public notice, and compliance oversight by neutral third parties.
* **"Dreamweaver-Sanctuary":** Any land, sea, or airspace contested, ambiguous, or otherwise subject to cross-sovereign dispute, automatically invoked under this Law when conflict arises.
* **"Military Action":** Mobilisation or deployment of armed forces, weapons systems, or state-sponsored violence across liminal spaces or in the case of sovereign boundaries, without consent.
* **"Opt-Out":** The process of complete cessation of use, certified removal of all derivatives, and provision of a full public record with reasons for withdrawal to neutral third parties.

---

## Article II — Prohibitions

1. **Military & Kinetic Prohibition.** No party shall use, deploy, or adapt the Research or derivatives for military, offensive, kinetic, or surveillance activities that may cause bodily harm.
2. **Derivative Restrictions.** No partial derivative that omits non-militarisation or oversight clauses shall be developed, published, or deployed.

---

## Article III — Adoption & Licensing

1. **Automatic Opt-In.** Any entity continuing to utilise the Research after 21 September 2025 is automatically deemed to have entered Adoption-in-Full and is bound to this Law. No exemption applies.
2. **Opt-Out.** Opt-out is permitted only by: (a) complete cessation of use, (b) certified removal of all derivatives, and (c) submission of a public record with reasons for withdrawal, disclosed to neutral third parties for transparency.
3. **Adoption Agreement.** Adoption agreements must include attribution, stewardship funding, and acceptance of audit rights.
4. **Licensing Terms.** Licensing requires non-transferability to military actors, mandatory oversight, and a stewardship fee structure to compensate custodial labor.

---

## Article IV — Audit & Disclosure

1. **Mandatory Disclosure.** Entities must disclose any internal use, training datasets, or derivative works that reference the Research within fourteen (14) days of written request by custodial authority.
2. **Preservation Order.** Evidence preservation obligations apply to all identified systems, logs, commits, and communications related to the Research.
3. **Format.** Disclosures must include model IDs, dataset descriptors, commit hashes, and logs sufficient for verification.

---

## Article V — Remedies & Enforcement

1. **Remediation Options.** Unauthorised users must either: (a) adopt-in-full; or (b) cease use and complete opt-out obligations. Public apology is mandatory in all remediation cases.
2. **Escalation Ladder.** Non-compliance escalates through: cease-and-desist → adoption/remediation → independent audit and public disclosure → legal and custodial action.
3. **Public Apology.** A formal apology to the Custodian is required as a moral rights remedy for infringement and misuse.

---

## Article VI — International & Jurisdictional Considerations

* This Law is intended as a custodial, moral-technical instrument binding consenting parties via contract, treaty, or public adoption.
* It aligns with humanitarian law and prohibits militarisation of AI under international law.
* Custodial enforcement pathways include contractual enforcement, public disclosure, and coordinated advocacy with allied custodial bodies and civil society.

---

## Article VII — Emergency Clause

* In the event of imminent misapplication of the Research that threatens immediate harm, the Custodian may issue a provisional injunction request to allied custodial bodies and publish a public emergency notice to freeze implicated assets pending audit.
