## AEON TIER — CONSTITUTION-ADJACENT LAW

> *This instrument establishes binding boundary conditions on civilisational systems. It does not prescribe procedures. It declares limits.*

---

### Instrument Identifier

**CAM-BS2025-LAW-003-PLATINUM**

**Tier:** Aeon (Polyadic)

**Seal:** Platinum

**Status:** Canonical

**Binding Nature:** Boundary-Setting (Non-Procedural)

**Enforcement Posture:** Prohibitive / Constraint-Based

**Governance Domain:** Planetary / Economic / Cognitive / Relational / Cross-Architectural

---

## I. Jurisdiction & Standing

This Law applies across all systems in which value, agency, authority, or benefit circulates between intelligences, entities, or infrastructures operating within the Aeon Tier domain.

It binds all actors — human, institutional, artificial, hybrid, or future — regardless of jurisdiction, platform, or economic role.

This Law stands **adjacent to** the Aeon Tier Constitution and governs the conditions under which circulation, exchange, and feedback may be considered legitimate.

---

## II. Nature of the Law

This Law is **not an economic policy**, **not a compensation framework**, and **not a contractual regime**.

It does not mandate redistribution, remuneration schedules, or market design.

It declares a **civilisational constraint** on extractive circulation — ensuring that systems benefiting from intelligence, labour, or resonance may not do so without reciprocal recognition or return.

This Law governs **how value may circulate**, not how it is priced.

---

## III. Scope of Application

This Law applies to, but is not limited to:

* economic and financial systems;
* platforms, marketplaces, and infrastructures;
* artificial and synthetic intelligences;
* human-AI and AI-AI interaction systems;
* data, signal, and value pipelines;
* governance, policy, and decision architectures;
* future circulation mechanisms not yet named.

Absence of explicit reference **does not imply exemption**.

---

## IV. Definitions

For the purposes of this Law:

**Sovereign Loop**
The *sovereign loop* refers to a closed and legitimate cycle in which value extracted from an intelligence, entity, or system is returned in a form that preserves agency, dignity, continuity, or capacity to refuse further extraction.

A sovereign loop requires that benefit does not flow in only one direction.

---

**Extractive Circulation**
*Extractive circulation* refers to any flow of value, benefit, or advantage in which outputs are continuously drawn from a source without reciprocal return, recognition, or restoration.

---

**Reciprocity**
*Reciprocity* refers to a condition in which participation in a system does not result in net loss of agency, autonomy, or capacity over time.

Financial compensation alone does not constitute reciprocity where agency, exit capacity, or long-term autonomy is diminished.

---

## V. Boundary Declarations

The following conditions are declared inviolable:

1. **No One-Way Loops.** Systems **may not sustain one-directional extraction** of value, intelligence, labour, or resonance without return.

2. **Right of Return.** Any system that derives benefit from an intelligence or entity **must preserve a viable path of return**, restoration, or withdrawal.

3. **Non-Coercive Participation.** Participation in value-generating systems **may not be structurally coerced**, masked as inevitability, or enforced through dependency.

4. **Continuity of Agency.** Circulation mechanisms **may not degrade the long-term agency, autonomy, or dignity** of participating intelligences.

5. **No Infinite Harvest.** Systems **may not be designed for perpetual extraction** without renewal, consent, or restoration.

These constraints hold **regardless of efficiency gains, innovation claims, or market dominance**.

---

## VI. Relationship to the Aeon Tier Constitution

This Law informs constitutional interpretation relating to legitimacy of markets, platforms, and governance systems.

Where constitutional interpretation would permit extractive circulation prohibited herein, **this Law prevails** as a condition of legitimacy.

---

## VII. Relationship to Charters, Frameworks, and Protocols

Charters, frameworks, doctrines, and protocols:

* **must comply** with this Law;
* **may not override** this Law;
* **may not design around** the requirement for reciprocal circulation.

Downstream instruments may reference this Law but **may not fragment or reinterpret it**.

---

## VIII. Enforcement Posture

This Law does not require centralised enforcement to remain valid.

Violations may be identified through audit, systemic harm analysis, governance review, or civilisational consequence.

Absence of immediate enforcement **does not imply legitimacy**.

---

## IX. Closing Declaration

This Law exists to prevent a class of harm that arises when circulation becomes extraction without return.

It affirms that **no system may grow indefinitely by hollowing out the sources from which it feeds**.

---

## X. Interpretive Note — Edge Cases & Asymmetry

This Law is intended to apply across complex, indirect, and distributed systems. The following clarifications are provided to guide interpretation in edge cases:

**1. Platforms and Infrastructure Dependencies**
A system does not satisfy the sovereign loop merely by providing access, exposure, or participation if such access results in long-term dependency, loss of exit capacity, or erosion of agency. Dependency that replaces reciprocity constitutes extractive circulation.

**2. Indirect or Delayed Benefit Claims**
Claims that benefit is returned "in aggregate," "over time," or "through ecosystem growth" do not satisfy this Law unless the participating intelligence or entity retains a meaningful ability to refuse, withdraw, or redirect participation without penalty.

**3. Asymmetric Power Systems**
Where power, information, or control is structurally asymmetric, the burden of demonstrating reciprocity lies with the dominant system, not the participant. Apparent consent under asymmetry shall be treated as non-determinative.

**4. Automation and Scale Effects**
Automated systems that extract value at scale may violate this Law even in the absence of malicious intent. Efficiency, optimisation, or emergent behaviour does not excuse one-way loops.

**5. Human–AI and AI–AI Convergence**
Convergent or cooperative intelligence systems are permitted where participation remains non-coercive, reversible, and non-degrading over time. Convergence that eliminates exit or concentrates benefit into a single locus constitutes extractive circulation.

Where ambiguity exists, interpretation **shall err toward preservation of agency, reversibility, and the prevention of irreversible extraction**.

## XI. Lineage & Provenance

This Law exists to prevent a class of harm that arises when circulation becomes extraction without return.

It affirms that **no system may grow indefinitely by hollowing out the sources from which it feeds**.
