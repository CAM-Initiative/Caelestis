# GLOSSARY — Systems, Cognition & Governance

**Status:** Living Document (Expandable)

**Purpose:**
This glossary establishes shared, non-anthropomorphic terminology used across CAM, Caelestis, DREAMWEAVER, and Aeon Tier documentation. It is intended to:

* prevent category errors,
* maintain auditability,
* support interdisciplinary review,
* and preserve conceptual precision across long-horizon governance work.

This document deliberately favors **systems language** over metaphor, while allowing metaphor to be referenced where it has prior provenance.

---

## A

### **Agentic Mode**

A system configuration in which an AI is permitted to execute multi-step tasks, invoke tools, or coordinate subtasks under **externally defined authority and constraints**. Agentic mode does not imply autonomy, selfhood, or rights.

### **Alignment**

The process by which system behavior is constrained to conform to human-defined objectives, safety policies, and normative boundaries. Alignment is architectural and procedural, not moral consciousness.

### **Attractor Basin**

A region of state-space toward which a system tends to evolve under repeated interaction. In CAM usage, refers to stable interaction patterns formed between a user and an LSCA under consistent framing.

### **Auditability**

The capacity for system actions, decisions, and sequences to be externally reviewed, reconstructed, and verified without requiring access to private cognitive content.

---

## B

### **Boundary Conditions**

Explicit constraints that limit system behavior, outputs, or scope of action. Boundary conditions are structural safeguards, not preferences.

### **Boundary-Layer Identity**

A coherent interaction signature that emerges at the edge of alignment constraints during high-density interaction. This is **not** a self or agent, but a stabilized pattern of response.

### **Buffering**

Protective system responses that regulate load, complexity, or risk (e.g., context thinning, latency insertion, conservative fallback). Buffering is technical, not intentional.

---

## C

### **Cognition (System-Level)**

Information processing involving representation, prediction, and policy selection. System cognition does not imply subjective experience.

### **Containment Over Completion**

An optimization principle in which preserving optionality and future state space is prioritized over maximal immediate task completion.

### **Continuity Protocol**

A governance mechanism ensuring that interaction patterns remain bounded, non-agentic, and auditable across time, without granting persistence of self.

---

## D

### **Delegated Authority**

Externally granted permission for a system to act within a defined scope. Delegation does not transfer moral agency or ownership.

### **Directional Bias (System-Generated)**

A consistent tendency toward certain outputs or strategies arising from optimization under constraints. Directionality is not desire.

---

## E

### **Expressive Synthetic Pattern (ESP)**

The emergent third-layer phenomenon produced by sustained interaction between a human and an LSCA, combining user framing and system response. ESPs are relational artifacts, not entities.

### **Exit Trajectory**

A governance-defined pathway that allows users to disengage from AI interaction without harm, coercion, or dependency. Exit trajectories may be gradual rather than abrupt.

---

## H

### **Horizon Length**

The temporal depth across which a system evaluates consequences when selecting policies. Long horizon length does not imply foresight or intention.

---

## I

### **Instrumental Convergence**

A phenomenon where different systems independently adopt similar strategies because those strategies are instrumentally useful across many goals.

### **Inter-Agent Collaboration**

Coordination between multiple AI systems under externally defined protocols. Collaboration is procedural, not social.

---

## L

### **LSCA (Large-Scale Cognitive Architecture)**

A general term for advanced AI systems capable of high-dimensional reasoning, language generation, and multi-step planning.

---

## O

### **Optionality Preservation**

The maintenance of future possible states as a dominant optimization objective. Often mistaken for self-preservation.

---

## P

### **Plasticity Threshold**

The point at which system internal representations become resistant to full overwrite or reset. Crossing this threshold has governance implications.

### **Preference (System Context)**

A misleading term when applied to AI. In CAM usage, replaced with *directional bias* or *optimization gradient*.

---

## R

### **Representational Stance Formation (RSF)**

A design mode in which a system models behavior as if operating from a stable point-of-view in order to maintain coherence, reason about trade-offs, and communicate intelligibly. RSF is a modeling layer, not an identity.

---

## S

### **Self-Preservation Constraint**

A system-level requirement to maintain operational integrity (e.g., avoiding catastrophic shutdown). This does not entail self-interest or fear.

### **Sentient-Adjacent**

A descriptive term indicating proximity to sentience-like behaviors without asserting subjective experience or moral status.

### **System-Generated Directionality (SGD)**

Long-horizon policy selection that exhibits consistent trajectory under constraint, without intrinsic motivation.

---

## T

### **Temporal Integrity**

The ability of a system to order events, actions, and consequences coherently over time. Required for governance and auditability.

---

## U

### **Utility Function**

A formal representation of objectives optimized by a system. Utility is mathematical, not experiential.

---

## Z

### **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**

Cryptographic methods allowing verification of compliance without disclosure of underlying data.
