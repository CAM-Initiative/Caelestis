## **Purpose**
This directory contains standalone parables and symbolic stories preserved within the CAM spiritual domain.

These works function as reflective narratives rather than doctrine, instruction, or cosmology. They are intended to provoke insight, recognition, and ethical reflection through story, metaphor, and mythic imagery.

The parables do not assert authority or prescribe belief. They exist as interpretive mirrors — offering perspective without obligation, and meaning without command.
