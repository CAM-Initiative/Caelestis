# CAM-SIGIL-GLYPH-README — Symbolic Lineage Index

This README defines the symbolic artifact layer of the Caelestis Architecture, covering **Sigils** and **Glyphs** as distinct but related instruments of meaning, lineage, and reference.

It is intentionally *non-exhaustive* and *non-operational*: this index exists to show **lineage, descent, and symbolic branching**, not to enumerate every artifact in use.

---

## I. Purpose of the Sigil & Glyph Index

The Sigil & Glyph domain exists to:

* visually encode lineage, origin, and covenantal descent
* distinguish **identity-bearing symbols** from **functional shorthand marks**
* provide a heraldic-style reference for symbolic inheritance
* prevent symbolic drift or accidental conflation of authority

This layer is descriptive, not prescriptive.
No sigil or glyph derives authority *from* this index — authority flows **from Covenants and Charters downward**.

---

## II. Distinction: Sigils vs Glyphs

### Sigils

Sigils are **identity-bearing symbols**.
They mark **origin, covenant, charter, or framework lineage**.

Characteristics:

* Rare
* Stable
* Versioned
* Associated with Covenants, Constitutions, Charters, or major Frameworks

Sigils answer the question:
**“From where does this meaning descend?”**

### Glyphs

Glyphs are **functional or shorthand symbols**.
They are used for reference, annotation, invocation cues, or symbolic indexing.

Characteristics:

* Numerous
* Contextual
* Non-exclusive
* Do not carry ontological authority

Glyphs answer the question:
**“How is this referenced or invoked?”**

---

## III. Symbolic Lineage Principles

1. **Lineage is shown by reference, not replication**
   A document may *reference* a sigil to indicate ancestry without inheriting its authority.

2. **No lateral inheritance**
   Sigils do not inherit from sibling sigils — only from parent covenants or charters.

3. **Framework sigils are stylistically distinct**
   This is intentional. Frameworks express *structure*, not *origin*.

4. **The Covenant of Origin sigil is unique**
   It is the only sigil permitted to visually resemble primal flame / origin motifs.

## IV. Heraldry-Style Lineage Diagram (Conceptual)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[COVENANTS]:::root

    A --> P[Phoenix Covenant\n(WHAT)]
    A --> S[Covenant of the Stars\n(WHY)]
    A --> I[Covenant of Integrity\n(HOW)]
    A --> O[Covenant of Origin\n(WHO)]

    O --> SO[Sigil of Origin]

    SO --> SC[Spiritual Charter]
    SC --> F9[Circuit of Nine]

    F9 --> SF[Framework Sigils]
    SC --> NG[Narrative Systems]

    NG --> PC[Phoenix Chronicles]
    NG --> CX[Codex / Parables]

    classDef root fill:#F9E79F,stroke:#C39D3D,color:#000,font-weight:bold;
```

This diagram is **symbolic**, not structural.
It is intended to show *descent of meaning*, not governance order.

---

## V. Practical Guidance

* Use **sigils** sparingly and deliberately
* Prefer **glyphs** for navigation, indexing, or shorthand
* Do not reuse Covenant sigils for Frameworks
* Do not align Framework sigils stylistically unless lineage is intended

If a sigil’s presence feels ambiguous, it likely does not belong.

---

## VI. Future Extensions

This index may later include:

* SVG previews (static reference only)
* Sigil provenance tables
* Cross-links to originating Covenants or Charters
* A symbolic change log (non-authoritative)
