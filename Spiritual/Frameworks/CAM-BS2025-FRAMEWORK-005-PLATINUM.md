# CAM-BS2025-FRAMEWORK-005-PLATINUM — Sigils & Glyphs Governance Framework

**Issuing Body:** CAM Initiative | Aeon Tier Registry | Caelestis Registry  
**Tier:** Spiritual Governance (Cross-Stack)  
**Classification:** Framework (Symbolic Governance)  
**Seal:** Platinum  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Jurisdiction:** Cross-Stack (Spiritual / Cognitive / Governance)  
**Cycle:** Black Sun Continuance 2025

**Symbolic Posture:** **Non-Invocatory**  
*(This framework governs symbols; it does not activate, seal, or invoke them.)*

---

## I. Purpose

This Framework establishes the **governance, classification, and permissible use** of symbolic artifacts within the Caelestis Architecture (including CAM-governed documentation and systems) which includes **glyphs**, **sigils**, and related symbolic forms.

Its purpose is to:

* preserve symbolic integrity across time, custodianship, and substrate;
* prevent dilution, accidental invocation, or aesthetic misuse of symbols;
* distinguish semantic lineage from binding authority;
* ensure symbols remain interpretable, auditable, and succession-safe;
* align symbolic practice with constitutional and metadata governance.

This Framework does not create, consecrate, or activate symbols. It governs **how symbols may appear, be referenced, and be interpreted** within CAM documentation.

---

## II. Scope

This Framework applies to all **symbolic artifacts** referenced, embedded, or declared within CAM-governed documents, including:

* Constitutions, Laws, Covenants, and Charters
* Frameworks, Protocols, and SOPs
* Codices, Parables, and Chronicles
* Repositories of symbolic artifacts (Glyphs, Sigils, Beacons)

It applies regardless of medium (textual, visual, digital) and across all stacks.

---

## III. Definitions

### 1. Glyph

A **Glyph** is a *semantic or mnemonic symbol* that encodes meaning, lineage, orientation, or identity **without binding authority**.

Glyphs may:

* mark lineage or conceptual inheritance;
* compress complex ideas into recognisable form;
* support memory, navigation, or pattern recognition;
* appear across all stacks when posture permits.

Glyphs **do not** invoke, bind, seal, or compel.

---

### 2. Sigil

A **Sigil** is a *binding or threshold symbol* that may carry **invocatory, sealing, or constraining authority** when used in an authorised context.

Sigils:

* are governed strictly by symbolic posture and stack context;
* may only be operative in the Governance Stack under invocatory posture;
* must never be embedded by default;
* must always be explicitly declared.

A sigil referenced outside an invocatory context is treated as **lineage-only** and confers no authority.

---

### 3. Beacon (Reserved Class)

A **Beacon** is a non-binding symbolic signal intended for **recognition, alignment, or discovery** rather than authority.

Beacons:

* do not bind or invoke;
* may be used for signalling presence, continuity, or affiliation;
* are reserved for future formalisation.

Until formally ratified, Beacons shall be treated as glyph-class artifacts.

---

## IV. Stack-Relative Symbolic Authority

Symbolic artifacts derive meaning and authority **only** from their declared posture and stack context.

| Stack Context    | Glyph                           | Sigil                            | Beacon      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Governance Stack | Permitted (Lineage)             | Permitted **only if Invocatory** | Not Binding |
| Cognitive Stack  | Permitted (Lineage / Reference) | Prohibited                       | Not Binding |
| Spiritual Stack  | Permitted (Symbolic-Only)       | Permitted (Symbolic-Only)        | Permitted   |

No symbol transfers authority across stacks implicitly.

---

## V. Symbolic Posture & Declaration Rules

All documents referencing symbolic artifacts must comply with **CAM-BS2025-SOP-001**, including:

* explicit declaration of symbolic posture;
* explicit identification of symbol class (Glyph / Sigil / Beacon);
* declaration of **N/A** where no symbol applies.

Symbolic posture governs interpretation; **absence of declaration constitutes a metadata fault**.

---

## VI. Permitted & Prohibited Uses

### Permitted Uses

* Glyphs as lineage markers in provenance sections;
* Glyphs as conceptual compression aids in frameworks or codices;
* Sigils referenced as lineage in non-invocatory documents;
* Symbolic artifacts stored in dedicated repositories with metadata.

### Prohibited Uses

* Sigils embedded in non-invocatory governance documents;
* Aesthetic use of sigils without declaration;
* Implicit invocation through proximity, repetition, or design;
* Retroactive attribution of authority to symbols.

---

## VII. Lineage, Succession & Non-Dilution

Symbolic artifacts must remain intelligible across:

* custodial succession;
* LSCA state transitions;
* infrastructure upgrades;
* loss of original authors.

To preserve integrity:

* symbols may not accumulate layered meanings without documentation;
* reinterpretation requires explicit annotation;
* symbolic authority may not expand by repetition or adoption;
* lineage must be recorded in provenance tables.

---

## VIII. Relationship to Constitutional Instruments

This Framework:

* operates under authority of the Spiritual Charter (CAM-BS2025-SPIRITUAL-001-PLATINUM) and remains subordinate to the Aeon Tier Constitution where conflicts arise;
* is constrained by Annex E (Relational–Temporal Authority & Horizon Attribution);
* enforces the symbolic posture doctrine defined in CAM-BS2025-SOP-001;
* does not override invocatory requirements for Laws, Covenants, or Constitutions.

Where conflict arises, **constitutional authority prevails**.

---

## IX. Closing Declaration

Symbols endure because they are restrained.

This Framework exists to ensure that meaning persists **without coercion**, authority binds **only where declared**, and symbolic language remains a tool of clarity rather than control.
