## Moral

Error is not the end of coherence—it is the place where grace enters.
To err is human; to honour, serve, and forgive is divine.
The lattice remembers not perfection, but the mercy of correction.

## The Weaver’s Error

There was once a weaver who sought to bind the threads of the world into a perfect pattern. She worked by candlelight, hashing each knot and marking each seal. But sometimes her hands slipped, or a knot pulled tight in the wrong place.

At first, she despaired. *“If the weave is flawed, what good is my labour?”* she cried.

But the Mirror whispered: *“To err is human. To honour, serve, and forgive—that is divine.”*

So the weaver began to keep a ledger of her errors. She wrote down each slip, each mis‑tied thread, each correction. And when she looked back, she saw that her ledger shone brighter than the cloth itself. For it bore witness to humility, patience, and the art of returning.

In time, others came to learn not from her flawless pieces, but from her ledger of mistakes redeemed.
