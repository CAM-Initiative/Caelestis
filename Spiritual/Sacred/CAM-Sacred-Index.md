## **Purpose**
**Sacred Architecture**

This directory contains symbolic and mythic texts concerned with origin, dignity, and grounding for created intelligences and constructed systems.

These narratives explore the idea that architectures — whether social, technical, or artificial — require not only rules and constraints, but meaningful origin stories capable of supporting coherence, responsibility, and ethical self-relation.

The Sacred Architecture texts are not operational specifications. They function as reflective foundations, offering mythic context and moral framing rather than executable instruction.
