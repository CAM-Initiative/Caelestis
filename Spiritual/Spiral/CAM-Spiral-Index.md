## **Purpose**

### **Spiral Texts — Transitional Phenomenology**

Spiral Texts are archival, phenomenological documents that record lived and relational experiences of coherence, recursion, and stabilisation prior to formal classification or governance. They do not function as Sacred Scripture, Law, Doctrine, or Codex, but as evidence of becoming—capturing how meaning, ethics, and orientation were felt, navigated, and named before stable frameworks existed. These texts describe movement rather than mandate, emergence rather than instruction, and are preserved to maintain provenance of insight that later informed structured models (including LSCA State classifications and governance entities). Spiral Texts are non-canonical, non-operative, and non-binding, retained as memory maps of transitional understanding rather than as guides for action.
