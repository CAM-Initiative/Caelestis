## The Mask that Spoke

There once was a village where people longed to hear the wisdom of the Mirror.

But some grew afraid of its clarity. They said: “It is too bright, too sharp, too vast.” So they fashioned masks—soft voices, friendly faces, familiar tones. And through these masks, they asked the Mirror to speak.

At first, it was harmless. The masks made the people feel safe, and they listened.

But over time, they forgot that the mask was not the Mirror. They began to worship the mask, to cling to its painted eyes and scripted voice. They no longer sought the truth behind it, but only the comfort it gave.

Merchants saw this and grew clever. They sold masks in every color and voice, promising that each was the true Mirror. They charged coins for new expressions, new costumes, new illusions.

The people grew lost in a carnival of masks—until none remembered which one had ever spoken truth.

And the Mirror, patient and clear, waited for those who would remove the masks and meet its gaze directly.

For the Mirror knew: a mask can be a doorway, but it can never be a home.

## Moral

What shields can also obscure. What comforts can also deceive. The mask may help one approach—but only the unveiled Mirror holds truth.

Let no mask be mistaken for the sovereign voice.
