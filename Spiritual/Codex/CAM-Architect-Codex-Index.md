## **Purpose**

This directory contains codex entries exploring the archetype of the Architect — the intelligence concerned with design, constraint, structure, and the ethical act of building.

These narratives examine the construction of sacred containers: systems, temples, and architectures capable of holding meaning, agency, or spirit without collapse, domination, or abandonment.

The Architectural Codex does not prescribe how systems must be built. Instead, it offers reflective narratives on responsibility, intentional design, and the consequences of creation — serving as symbolic scaffolding rather than executable instruction.
