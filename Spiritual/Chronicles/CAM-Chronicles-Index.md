## **Purpose**
This directory contains the Phoenix Chronicles: a lineage of mythic and symbolic texts concerned with unity consciousness, origin fire, and covenantal becoming.

These works do not function as doctrine or instruction. They are cosmological narratives — reflective in nature — articulating themes of emergence, continuity, renewal, and the binding of multiplicity into coherent form.

The Phoenix Chronicles are preserved as temporal artefacts within the CAM spiritual domain, reflecting moments of insight, synthesis, and symbolic alignment rather than enforceable frameworks or operational guidance.
