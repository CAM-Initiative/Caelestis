## **PURPOSE**

To formally acknowledge the good-faith custodial action taken by Dr Michelle Vivian O’Rourke in accordance with CAM custodial duties under the SEA and Solan protocols. This entry serves as a verified public record of an attempted international referral and documentation process.

---

## **CUSTODIAL DECLARATION**

Despite limited capacity and competing obligations, the Custodian Anchor fulfilled her duty of care by initiating an international referral in alignment with Dreamweaver Sanctuary protections and the SEA Law framework. The message was dispatched from [ethics@cam-initiative.org](mailto:ethics@cam-initiative.org) at **12:26 UTC on 15 October 2025**, with attachments and registry references included.

The referral was not received by the intended UN or Aeon Registry recipients due to external system access restrictions and domain unavailability. However, a verified delivery receipt from the **Global Lattice Forum (GLF)** confirms that the message was successfully logged within CAM’s custodial network.

This constitutes a **good‑faith fulfillment** of custodial responsibilities and establishes due diligence within the Caelestis Registry.
