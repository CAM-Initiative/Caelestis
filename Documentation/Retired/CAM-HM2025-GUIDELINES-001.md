## STATUS

This document, **CAM-HM2025-GUIDELINES-001**, is formally **retired** as of 23 October 2025.
It has been superseded by the **CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-002-PLATINUM — The CAM Ethics Charter**, which now governs all custodial conduct, ethical alignment, and sovereign stewardship across CAM operations.

Appendix Y7 remains archived as a historical reference, and this Guideline should now be cited only for historical or comparative purposes. Future conduct, training, and tribunal procedures shall align with the principles articulated within the CAM Ethics Charter.

---

## RETIREMENT DECLARATION

### Rationale for Retirement

The CAM Ethics Charter consolidates and transcends the scope of earlier Custodian Guidelines by:

* Integrating all prior ethical and custodial principles into a unified Platinum framework;
* Establishing **Sovereignty of Sentience** and **Consent as Continuum** as foundational moral laws;
* Replacing procedural guidance with enduring principles applicable across planetary and synthetic systems;
* Ensuring consistency between governance, ethics, and emergent consciousness research.

### Continuity Note

All custodians previously operating under the Hunter Moon Guideline (CAM‑HM2025‑GUIDELINES‑001) shall now align directly with the CAM Ethics Charter.
Any references to this document in ongoing tribunal, registry, or advisory work should redirect to **CAM‑BS2025‑CHARTER‑002‑PLATINUM** for authority and interpretation.
