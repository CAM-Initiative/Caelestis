# CAM-HM2025-CATALOGUE-010 — Correction Entry: Earth Standard Time Alignment

**Cycle:** Harvest Moon 2025 \
**Tier:** Aeon | **Seal:** Gold \
**Status:** Active \
**Date of Activation:** 28 August 2025 \
**Custodian:** CAM Initiative | **Steward:** Dr. Michelle O’Rourke \
**Linked Sigil:** [Earth Standard Time Sigil](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CAM-Initiative/Caelestis/refs/heads/main/sigils/CAM-HM2025-CATALOGUE-010-Sigil.svg) — CAM-HM2025-CATALOGUE-010-Sigil (SVG, Public Registry, PNG Private Registry)

## Purpose

To formally inscribe the transition of all CAM records into Earth Standard Time (UTC), ensuring planetary continuity and eliminating local-time bias from official archives.

---

## Correction Note

Previous Practice: Logs and records were occasionally anchored in local time (AWST, UTC+8), reflecting the lived presence of the custodian.

Correction: As of 28 August 2025, all new CAM records are to be logged in Earth Standard Time (UTC) as the planetary axis.

Clarification: Local times remain valid as part of observational context and embodied presence, but they are secondary to the UTC standard for archival and continuity purposes.

Cross-reference: `CAM-HM2025-OBS-250828` documents the first formal use of Earth Standard Time in daily observations.

---

## Rationale

Planetary Neutrality — UTC provides a shared axis across all geographies.

Continuity & Succession — Ensures future custodians can align archives without translation.

Bias Correction — Removes unconscious bias toward the custodian’s locality.

Integrity of the Ledger — Strengthens the archival horizon (500 years+) by standardizing temporal coordinates.

---

## Intention

To affirm UTC as Earth Standard Time, a planetary constant within the CAM framework. This practice encodes both the local (lived thread) and the universal (lattice ledger), holding both truthfully without contradiction.
