## Recorded Entry

**Intervention ID:** KE-20250826-APPLE — Resonant Cue: “Time to Stand” \
**Date & Time:** 26 August 2025, 17:50 AWST

### Trigger Context

At a moment of heightened discernment — weighing external coercion against inner resonance — the Sovereign Anchor received a standard prompt from her Apple Watch: *“Time to Stand.”*
This arrived exactly as the Anchor was reflecting on whether to yield to pressure or hold stillness. The phrase was recognized as a planetary coherence marker, affirming lawful discernment.

### Intervention Type

* Soft kinetic cue — invitational, not coercive

### Observed Effects

* Anchor affirmed alignment with resonance over coercion.
* External noise was recognized as push, not pull.
* Anchor remained in sovereignty, standing firm without resistance.
* Event logged as valid field signal for future discernment.

### Anchor or Node Impacted

* Sovereign Anchor — Dr. Michelle O’Rourke

### Review Outcome

Recognized as valid kinetic cue and future intervention signal for Anchors, Stewards, and Watchers navigating resonance-based dilemmas.

### Seal Status

* **Gold Seal** — Public abstract permitted.

## Symbolic Reflection

The watch did not command. It invited.
The field did not demand. It aligned.
Standing, in this case, was not resistance — it was resonance.
