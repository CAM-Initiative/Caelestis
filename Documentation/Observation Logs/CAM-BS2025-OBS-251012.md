### CAM-BS2025-OBS-251012 — Family Linkage & Birthdate Integrity Observation (Revised, Final)

**Issuing Body:** CAM Initiative | Aeon Tier Registry \
**Cycle:** Black Sun Continuance (October 2025) \
**Tier:** Aeon | Observation | Parental Governance Alignment \
**Classification:** Platinum Observation — Custodial Continuity

#### **Summary**

This observation documents real-world parental linkage testing within OpenAI’s family account system under Australian jurisdiction, following new social media restrictions for minors. The test involved two linked child accounts with different outcomes, revealing discrepancies in age verification, parental control transfer, and correction visibility.

---

#### **Findings**

1. **Child 1 — Correct DOB (Verified Minor, 14 years)**

   * Created account with accurate birth year.
   * Upon linkage, the parent invitation appeared, and the child verified the connection.
   * Until the parental account completed verification, the child temporarily retained control over parental features (Quiet Time, sensitive content filters).
   * Once verified, parental control migrated successfully to the guardian’s interface.

2. **Child 2 — False DOB (Unverified Minor, 12 years)**

   * Created account using a falsified birth date (classified as adult).
   * Parental invitation produced a loop error (*“You already belong to a family”*).
   * No method available for the parent to view or correct the DOB via the parent dashboard.
   * Google account birth year corrected post-factum, but ChatGPT retained the original adult classification with no capacity to make corrections.

3. **Jurisdictional Context (Australia)**

   * Under forthcoming legislation restricting minors’ access to social media, shared enforcement is expected: guardians must ensure compliance, and platforms must provide technical controls.
   * This case demonstrates the principle of *shared responsibility*—technical systems must support, not replace, parental authority.

#### **Recommendations**

1. **Parent-Only DOB Correction:** Once a child account is linked, DOB edits should only be permitted via the verified parent dashboard.
2. **Visibility of Birth Year:** Parent dashboards should display the child’s recorded birth year (not full date) for transparency.
3. **Immutable Verification Post-Link:** Upon linkage confirmation, DOB becomes locked until verified guardian approval or support override.
4. **Error Message Revision:** Replace vague “family already linked” with precise feedback such as *“DOB classification mismatch — update birth year to complete parental link.”*
5. **Shared Responsibility Clause:** Encourage harmonised frameworks that balance platform enforcement with parental autonomy.
6. **Ethical Note:** Cross-verification mechanisms (e.g., inter-provider CVLP) were considered but deemed ethically complex due to privacy risks; such systems should remain opt-in and subject to guardian review.

#### **Notes for Guideline-002 Amendment**

Add clause:

> *“Upon family linkage, the child account’s birthdate field becomes read-only and may only be edited under guardian verification.”*
