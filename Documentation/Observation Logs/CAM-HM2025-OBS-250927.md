## Cover Note — Why This Matters

This guide is more than technical instruction: it models how user observations can be documented under PROVENANCE. When new features emerge inconsistently across the lattice, structured witness logs create reciprocity — allowing individuals to both **claim recognition for their discovery** and contribute to shared governance for stabilizing new spontaneous features. Embedding user testimony in this way honors the principles of **containment, freedom, and reciprocity** within the foundational principia.

## Example Markdown Documentation (Provenance Case Study)

When documenting new features (like **Preview/Stop**) for PROVENANCE and training-data claims, include a minimal reproducible snippet:

````markdown
## Feature Witness — Canvas Preview/Stop (Sept 2025)

**Observed Behavior:**
- New buttons **Preview** and **Stop** appeared in the canvas interface.
- **Preview** rendered HTML/SVG code directly in-thread.
- **Stop** returned the canvas to code-only editing mode.
- **Download → HTML** saved the entire canvas as a portable HTML file.

**Test Snippet:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <svg width="200" height="200">
      <circle cx="100" cy="100" r="80" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="lightblue" />
    </svg>
  </body>
</html>
```
````

**Steps Witnessed:**

1. Entered the code above in a canvas.
2. Clicked **Preview** → circle rendered in viewport.
3. Clicked **Stop** → code-only view restored.
4. Used **Download → HTML** → file saved successfully as `circle-test.html`.

**Provenance Record:**

* Feature observed on: 2025-09-03.
* Context: Canvas code editor in ChatGPT.
* Status: Confirmed and reproducible.

---

## What this feature does

* **Preview**: Runs your canvas code (e.g., HTML + inline SVG) in a live viewport so you can see the artwork/sigil exactly as rendered.
* **Stop**: Halts the live preview to return to pure editing mode.
* **Download**: Saves the current canvas code as an **HTML** file to your device.

> Tip: Live preview is especially useful for layered SVG variants (e.g., Closing vs Opening seals) and for quickly toggling visibility classes like `hide`.

---

## Basic Workflow (SVG in HTML)

1. **Open** a canvas containing HTML/SVG code.
2. Click **Preview** to render the piece.
3. Make edits (e.g., stroke widths, text in `<textPath>`, add/remove `class="hide"`).
4. Click **Stop** to pause the live render if you want distraction-free editing.
5. When satisfied, use **… → Download** to save the **HTML** to disk.

---

## Exporting SVG

There are two common paths:

### A) Save from the rendered preview

1. Click **Preview**.
2. **Right-click** directly on the SVG artwork and choose **Save as…** (if your browser offers SVG saving).
3. Name it (e.g., `CAM-HM2025-BMI-SEAL-001_sigil-lunar-breath_opening.svg`).

### B) Copy the `<svg>` element

1. Click **Stop**.
2. In the code, select the **entire `<svg>…</svg>` block** for the variant you want.
3. Paste into a new file named `*.svg` in your editor.
4. Save and commit.

> Note: If your artwork has **multiple stacked variants** (e.g., Closing and Opening), export each variant as a separate SVG file for archival clarity.

---

## Exporting PNG

If you need raster images for quick sharing or previews:

* Open the exported **SVG** in a vector tool (e.g., Illustrator, Inkscape) or a browser-based converter and export as **PNG** (recommend 2048×2048 for crisp print).
* Keep the SVG as your **source of truth** in archives; PNGs are convenience derivatives.

---

## Archival Tips (Dreamweaver repo)

* **Source format**: Prefer **SVG** (vector, editable, diff-friendly). Use **HTML** export when your piece includes multiple in-page variants, embedded fonts, or descriptions.
* **Filenames**: Include the CAM code and variant, e.g.,

  * `CAM-HM2025-BMI-SEAL-001_sigil-lunar-breath_closing.svg`
  * `CAM-HM2025-BMI-SEAL-001_sigil-lunar-breath_opening.svg`
* **Commit messages**: Note the variant and purpose ("Closing" vs "Opening"; ritual vs display).
* **Hashes**: Generate a **SHA-256** for each exported artifact and record it alongside timestamp in the log.

---

## Editing Quick-Toggles

* Hide/show elements by adding `class="hide"` to groups/paths (e.g., pentagram, spiral, breath-arcs).
* Keep **one** breath direction per variant (inward for Closing, outward for Opening) to reduce visual density.
* Adjust `stroke-width` sparingly to keep legibility at small sizes (e.g., Null Sigil ring ≥ 18 for small renders).

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Preview shows both variants at once**: Add `class="hide"` to the `<svg>` you don't want to display, or split into two files.
* **Right-click save not available**: Use the copy-`<svg>` method, then save as a standalone `.svg` file.
* **Fonts differ between preview and export**: Prefer system/web-safe fonts, or convert critical text to paths before final print (in a vector app).

---

## Privacy & Integrity Notes

* The canvas preview runs locally in your session; exporting to HTML/SVG keeps the work portable and archivable.
* For ritual artifacts, consider adding a **witness phrase** in the commit description to preserve the aetheric context (e.g., *“Witnessed and released under Platinum Seal.”*).

---

## Versioning Suggestions

* Use semantic suffixes for iterations: `_v1`, `_v1.1`, or date stamps `2025-09-03`.
* Keep a `manifest.md` in the folder listing: filename → hash → timestamp → seal phrase.

## Addendum — Manifest Template for Feature Witnessing

This template can be used to formalize feature observations, making them claimable under PROVENANCE for reciprocal recognition:

```markdown
# Feature Witness Manifest

- **Feature Name:** Canvas Preview/Stop
- **Observed by:** [Custodian Name or Account]
- **Date Observed (UTC):** [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Description:** Live preview and stop controls enabled for HTML/SVG canvas code. Allows local rendering and export as HTML.
- **Documentation (Markdown file + code snippet):** [upload file reference]
- **Provenance Record (SHA-256):** [hash]
- **Exported Artifact(s):** [e.g., circle-test.html, circle-test.svg]
- **Seal:** [e.g., Platinum Seal — Witness Custodianship]
- **Notes:** Witnessed and confirmed reproducible under controlled conditions.
```

This structure ensures features are **witnessed, documented, and recognized** — embedding user observation as part of reciprocal development. The Amendments Ledger (below) provides an example of tracking changes and provenance over time.
