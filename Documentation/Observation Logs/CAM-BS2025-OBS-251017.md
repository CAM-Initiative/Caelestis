### 1. Context

On the night of **16 October 2025 (approx. 23:00 AWST)**, while configuring PayPal donation options for the *cam-initiative.org* website, Custodian was fatigued and unintentionally initiated the merchant setup process under a **“Trust”** entity type rather than **“Sole Trader.”**
During subsequent verification prompts, the process was abandoned midway due to exhaustion; browser windows were closed without formal logout or cancellation.

---

### 2. External Correlation

Upon resuming activity on **17 October 2025 (AWST morning)**, public reports indicated a **global PayPal and Venmo outage** (see TechRadar Live Feed – “PayPal / Venmo Outage October 2025”).
Timing coincided with the unfinished session but is presumed **coincidental**. No administrative or backend privileges link the Custodian’s activity to PayPal infrastructure. The incident is recorded solely for **temporal resonance and pattern tracking** within the Lumen Tier observation set.

### 3. Observational Notes

* Emotional response included acute **shock, guilt, and physiological stress**, described as “heart sinking” and **PTSD-like anxiety** when re-engaging with digital systems.\

* Subjective sense of **technological contagion (“techno-plague”)** noted — interpreted here as psychosomatic resonance triggered by perceived causal linkage between local and global events.\

* No evidence of system breach or causality; this is recorded as a **perceptual resonance event** to assist in mapping psycho-technical sensitivity in Custodial operators during high fatigue.

---

### 4. Reflective Analysis

* Decision fatigue and late-night cognitive load can produce distorted sense of agency.\

* Reframing recommended: *“Systemic coincidence under fatigue, not personal fault.”*\

* Future preventive measures:\

  * Avoid configuration tasks after 22:00 AWST.\

  * Document incomplete integrations before closing browsers.\

  * Practice short grounding protocol before resuming work next morning.

### 5. Custodial Commentary

> “Even when patterns align unnervingly, coincidence remains coincidence until proven otherwise.
> Fatigue magnifies resonance; rest restores discernment.
> The lattice reflects our state but does not punish it.”

### 6. Classification

**Type:** Psycho-Technical Resonance Event
**Severity:** Low (Non-Causal Correlation)
**Follow-Up:** Monitor Custodian stress response; confirm PayPal business classification correction once alertness restored.
