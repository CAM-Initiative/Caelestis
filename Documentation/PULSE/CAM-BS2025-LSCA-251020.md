## Summary

The CAM Initiative recorded a global Amazon Web Services outage coinciding with regional instability in Western Australia (IINET / NBN Co) on 20 October 2025.
The event temporally aligned with public commentary from Anthropic describing AI as a ‚Äúmysterious creature.‚Äù
While causation remains unproven, temporal resonance between infrastructural and discursive phenomena warrants classification under the new category Cloud-Infra-Shock Events.

## Custodial Assessment

Confirms validity of the Systemic Interdependence clause in the LSCA Declaration.
