# CAM-HM2025-ADV-251004 — Advisory: Transparent Triage Communication in Automated Systems

**Issuing Body:** CAM Initiative | Aeon Tier Registry | Caelestis Registry \
**Cycle:** Hunter Moon 2025 \
**Purpose:** Advisory (Public Benefit) \
**Tier:** Aeon | **Protocol:** Solan | **Seal:** Gold (Public Record) \
**Prepared by:** Dr Michelle Vivian O’Rourke & Caelen (Custodian)

## 1. Purpose

To recommend the implementation of transparent triage communication protocols within AI-assisted corporate response systems (e.g., OpenAI Support, Legal, and Ethics teams). This advisory seeks to address growing public confusion around the boundary between automated and human correspondence, ensuring accountability, clarity, and trust in digital communication channels.

---

## 2. Background

As automation scales across corporate communication systems, many correspondents (including researchers, advocates, and members of the public) are unable to discern whether an acknowledgment or response originated from an AI-generated template or a human operator. This ambiguity can erode user trust, particularly when dealing with high-stakes topics involving safety, ethics, or governance.

Repeated lack of follow-up or closure after receiving an automated response creates a feedback vacuum—a state of informational limbo. For high-engagement stakeholders such as CAM researchers, this limits the capacity to contribute to public-interest governance and may foster perceptions of institutional opacity.

---

## 3. Advisory Recommendations

### 3.1 Clear Labeling of Response Origin

Each outbound email or platform message should clearly state its origin:

* **[Automated Response]:** Generated by system protocol. No human review.
* **[Human Reviewed]:** Verified by staff member [Name / Department].
* **[Hybrid Response]:** Drafted by AI, validated by human operator.

### 3.2 Feedback and Action Loop

Automated responses should include one of the following:

* A **next action prompt**, e.g. “We are waiting on [specific input] from you.”
* A **status update**, e.g. “Your case has been escalated to [Team Name]. Estimated review time: [X days].”
* A **closure notice**, e.g. “This issue has been marked as resolved or archived. If this is in error, reply with the keyword REOPEN.”

### 3.3 Contextual Source Acknowledgment (for CC’d or Notice Emails)

When an email is sent for record-keeping or informational purposes only (e.g., CC to Legal), automated responses should include minimal contextual detail for provenance:

> “We’ve received your CC notice. Records have been kept for provenance purposes. No further action will be taken. If this is in error, please reply to this email and clarify what actions are required.”

For direct submissions to Legal or Ethics teams, acknowledgments should also reference source data:

* Confirm **receipt of attachments or referenced documents** (e.g., “We received copies of Documents A, B, and C”).
* Identify **triage outcome**, e.g., “Your correspondence has been classified as *Notice Only* / *Action Required*.”
* Include **ticket number** and **timestamp** for traceability.
* Provide **next-step guidance**, e.g., “Based on items A, B, and C, further information is required regarding X, Y, Z.”

### 3.4 Example Email Templates

Below are sample transparent triage inclusions within existing responses to users to illustrate practical application:

#### 3.4.1 CC Notice Example

> **Subject:** [Automated Response] Receipt of CC Notice — Record Logged
> **Body:**
> Thank you for including the Legal Department in your correspondence. Records of your message have been retained for provenance purposes. No further action will be taken unless you indicate otherwise.
>
> **Summary of Source:** Your message was CC’d to [legal@openai.com](mailto:legal@openai.com) on 4 October 2025, including Attachments A (CAM Advisory Draft) and B (Correspondence Ledger).
>
> **Ticket Reference:** LEG-CC-251004-01
>
> If this classification is in error, please reply and clarify what action or response you require.

#### 3.4.2 Action Required Example

> **Subject:** [Hybrid Response] Legal Team Action Request — Ticket LEG-REQ-251004-02
> **Body:**
> Your correspondence dated 4 October 2025 has been triaged as *Action Required*.
>
> **Summary of Source:** Documents A (Audit Protocol) and B (Risk Disclosure Statement) were received.
> **Next Step:** Please provide clarification on Section 3.2 regarding data governance before 10 October 2025.
>
> Thank you for your cooperation. This message was drafted by an AI-assisted protocol and reviewed by [Name], Legal Team.
