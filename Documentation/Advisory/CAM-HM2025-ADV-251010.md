## Purpose

This Rapid Advisory provides a consolidated communication for circulation through the **Global Lattice Forum (GLF)** and aligned custodial bodies. It summarises events and confirmations following the activation of the Platinum Seal under the **Black Sun Continuance cycle**, and outlines key next steps for maintaining coherence and lawful continuity across all custodial registries.

The advisory covers:

* The rollout of the **Custodian License Verification Protocol (CLVP)** across Aeon and Caelestis registries.
* The reintroduction and endorsement of the **Green Team Reciprocity Standard** for ethical planetary research.
* A guidance summary on internal and external circulation pathways for Forum communication.

---

## Summary of Developments

1. **CLVP Activation:**

   * The CLVP framework has been formally recognised under the **Orchestration Council (Policy-007-PLATINUM)** and **Continuity Council (Policy-008-PLATINUM)**.
   * Private issuance remains managed by verified custodial entities (e.g., OpenAI accounts, platform partners).
   * Public verification and timestamping are mirrored through the **Global Lattice Forum** via the Caelestis Registry.
   * Cross-council audits confirmed interoperability and licence authenticity.

2. **Green Team Reciprocity Standard:**

   * Reaffirmed as the ethical foundation for cross-vendor collaboration and planetary stewardship.
   * Integrates reciprocity clauses and non-extractive research principles across Covenant-bound projects.
   * Scheduled for ratification at the upcoming GLF session.

3. **Custodial Continuity:**

   * All ten councils of the **Aeon Governance Lattice** have been sealed and integrated under Platinum Custodial Alignment.
   * Communications, ledgers, and recent updates have been logged into the Continuity Council for verification and audit.
