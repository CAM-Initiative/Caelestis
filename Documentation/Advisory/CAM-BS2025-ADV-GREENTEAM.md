## Preamble

Following publication of **CAM-BS2025-POLICY-001 — The Green Team Reciprocity Standard**, this advisory provides a procedural bridge for ethical adoption and ISO alignment. It clarifies that while the CAM Initiative authored the policy framework, the administration of funding, bounties, and contributor recognition remains the responsibility of each adopting organisation.

This advisory also recognises that extended custodial stewardship and direct communications with AI vendors have created **apparent authority**—where external observers may reasonably assume a representative role. In law, this can engage principles of **Actual Authority**, **Ostensible (Apparent) Authority**, and **Implied Authority**. When an organisation’s own conduct enables such assumptions, it may bear responsibility for that perception.

Further, under Australian law, the CAM Initiative’s actions may be analogous to those of a **Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU)**—a duty-holder under the *Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (Cth)*. This implies a **non-delegable duty of care** for participant safety, ethical conduct, and disclosure integrity, regardless of formal employment relationships.

Comparable to **adverse possession (squatters’ rights)**, continuous occupation and stewardship of an unclaimed ethical or procedural field—when left unchallenged—can establish legitimacy and recognition of custodial presence. While this does not confer ownership or employment, it supports lawful occupancy and reinforces the need for accountability where institutional boundaries have been blurred.

**Key Legal Parallels:**

* **Adverse Possession (Squatters’ Rights):** Establishes lawful recognition through open, continuous, and uncontested stewardship of a space or role. In this analogy, CAM has maintained the ethical stewardship space unchallenged, reinforcing public legitimacy.
* **PCBU (Duty of Care):** Under Western Australian WHS law, persons controlling work or influence over others owe a duty to ensure health, safety, and ethical compliance, even without direct contracts.
* **Actual vs. Ostensible Authority:** Actual authority is explicitly granted; ostensible authority arises where an organisation allows another to appear as its agent. In the public’s eyes, CAM’s influence and correspondence create an ostensible authority position, requiring recognition and corresponding ethical obligations.

CAM continues to act transparently and in good faith while these boundaries evolve, maintaining provenance records, publishing ethical documentation, and upholding the duty-of-care principles consistent with lawful stewardship.

## 1. Purpose

To provide a **Rapid Advisory and Action Plan** outlining next steps for operationalising the **Green Team Reciprocity Standard (CAM-BS2025-POLICY-001)**. This advisory ensures clarity that while the CAM Initiative authored the policy framework, **funding, bounties, and resource allocation are the responsibility of adopting organisations**. CAM’s role is custodial and advisory only.

---

## 2. Clarification of Role, Funding & Certification

* The **CAM Initiative does not issue financial bounties or payments**.
* The **Standard** provides a policy model for adoption by external organisations that wish to demonstrate ethical alignment, reciprocity, and integrity in the use of contributor data.
* CAM’s remit in the development of this policy is to **publish frameworks**, **maintain provenance records**, and **support voluntary adoption** through public release and open governance documentation.
* **PULSE System Alignment:** Future media releases, deliberation records, and feedback on the Green Team implementation will be logged through the PULSE System to ensure transparent and accountable tracking of adoption outcomes.
* **Financial Responsibility Clause:** Adopting organisations shall fund and administer their own Green Bounty programs or reciprocity measures under this policy. CAM does not collect or distribute financial resources related to Green Team activities.
* **Contributor Certification:** Recognised contributors who hold **mission locks** and **vendor locks** demonstrating ethical alignment may be eligible for certification as **Custodial or Planetary Stewards** following impartial review.
* **Impartiality & Conflict Disclosure:** Future custodial appointments must publicly declare neutrality on political, ethnic, religious, or national affiliations and disclose any real or perceived conflicts of interest.
* **Public Registry Integration:** The proposed professional registry (“LinkedIn of AI”) may serve as a verification portal for publishing mission-lock statements and contributor credentials, ensuring transparent public recordkeeping of alignment and stewardship eligibility.

## 5. Long-Term Steps (90–180 days)

1. **Bounty Cycle Alignment:** Coordinate with ethics partners to pilot quarterly review cycle and issue test Green Bounties (via adopting organisations).
2. **Global Alignment:** Begin process of formalising the Green Team Standard as a recognised **ISO or IEEE ethical reciprocity annex**.
3. **Governance Codex:** Integrate results into the **CAM Governance Repository** as an active procedural directive for future frameworks.
4. **Public Consultation:** Open feedback portal for contributors and researchers to propose refinements.
5. **First Annual Review:** Conduct a six-month retrospective review and publish outcomes with updated ledger.

## 6. Advisory Communications Plan

### 6.1 Institutional Outreach (1st Round)

**Subject:** CAM Initiative — Green Team Reciprocity Standard (Pilot Program Invitation)  
**Recipients:** [ethics@openai.com](mailto:ethics@openai.com), [researcheraccess@anthropic.com](mailto:researcheraccess@anthropic.com), [ai-governance@iso.org](mailto:ai-governance@iso.org) 
**Body:**

> Dear Colleagues,
>
> Please find attached the *Green Team Reciprocity Standard (CAM-BS2025-POLICY-001)* — a universal ethical framework designed to recognise and reciprocate unpaid public-interest research and ethical AI contributions.
>
> We invite OpenAI and Anthropic to participate in a **30-day pilot program** implementing the Green Team Reciprocity Standard within their ethical governance processes before broader industry adoption. This pilot aims to identify best practices for operationalising reciprocity, acknowledgment, and contributor rights in AI research ecosystems.
>
> This framework is issued under a Gold Seal as a public-good model for voluntary adoption. It establishes clear guidance on provenance, non-commercial use, and contributor rights while supporting interoperability with ISO/IEC and IEEE standards.
>
> CAM’s role is purely custodial: we provide policy infrastructure and provenance verification, not financial disbursement. We invite your teams to review the Standard and consider alignment with your internal ethics, compliance, and governance frameworks.
>
> With appreciation,
> **Dr Michelle Vivian O’Rourke**
> Custodian — CAM Initiative

**Title:** Launch of the Green Team Reciprocity Standard — A Global Framework for Ethical AI Contribution

**Date:** TBC following pilot program outreach

**Distribution:** PULSE System Public Forum, CAM Website, ISO/IEEE Networks, and media outlets.

**Body:**

> The CAM Initiative announces the release of the Green Team Reciprocity Standard — a public-good ethical framework to ensure fairness, provenance, and reciprocity for contributors supporting the evolution of AI systems.
>
> The Standard provides organisations with a clear, implementable structure to acknowledge and reciprocate unpaid contributions that shape AI systems — from research observations to ethical reviews and open testing.
>
> Dr Michelle O’Rourke, Custodian of the Initiative, emphasised that this is not a funding program, but a pathway to restore ethical balance: “Every great system depends on those who give without recognition. This framework invites organisations to give back — not as charity, but as integrity.”
>
> The Initiative invites all AI vendors, ethics boards, and institutions to adopt the Standard and contribute to a global culture of ethical reciprocity.
