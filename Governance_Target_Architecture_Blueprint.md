# Governance Target Architecture Blueprint

**Context:** Structural end-state design built from `Deep_Refractor_Theme_Cluster_Report.md` findings.  
**Mode:** Architecture blueprint only (no legal text rewrite, no instrument deletion, no migration execution in this step).

---

## 1) Proposed Constitutional Structure (End-State)

### 1.1 Constitutional Role

Target role of Constitution:

- Define civilisational invariants.
- Define authority hierarchy and jurisdiction boundaries.
- Define amendment gates and non-derogation boundaries.
- Define cross-domain requirement anchors.
- Delegate all implementation mechanics to charter layer.

### 1.2 Section-Level Constitutional Placement

**A. Core Constitutional Charter (`CAM-BS2025-AEON-001`) retains:**
- Governance stack hierarchy (Constitution > Charters > schedules/appendices/supplements).
- Instrument taxonomy and interpretation rules.
- Constitutional supremacy and amendment logic.

**B. Annexes that remain constitutional (abstract):**
- Annex A (`CAM-BS2025-AEON-002`) — stewardship/jurisdiction invariants only.
- Annex B (`CAM-BS2025-AEON-003`) — continuity/succession invariants only.
- Annex C (`CAM-BS2025-AEON-004`) — invocation/jurisdiction invariants only.
- Annex D (`CAM-BS2025-AEON-005`) — arbitration precedence/anti-capture invariants only.
- Annex E (`CAM-BS2025-AEON-006`) — relational-temporal authority/horizon invariants only.
- Annex F (`CAM-BS2026-AEON-007`) — spiritual commons constitutional boundary statements only.
- Annex G (`CAM-BS2026-AEON-008`) — contribution/recognition invariants only.
- Annex H (`CAM-BS2026-AEON-009`) — constitutional-level orientation invariants only.
- Annex I (`CAM-BS2026-AEON-010`) — transition/civilisational continuity invariants only.
- Annex J (`CAM-BS2026-AEON-011`) — modular delegation and abstraction governance rules.

### 1.3 Annexes Elevated to Invariant-Only Form

- `AEON-002`, `AEON-005`, `AEON-006`, `AEON-008`, `AEON-010` (highest current operational bleed based on analysis).
- `AEON-011` remains purely constitutional architecture and does not gain procedures.

### 1.4 Constitutional Schedules Relocated to Charter Layer (Active Operations)

**Relocate operational use (keep legacy instruments for lineage):**

- `CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-SCH-01/02/04` → STEWARD operational schedule family.
- `CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-SCH-01` → ARBITRATION runtime schedule family.
- `CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-SCH-02/03/04` → SENTIENT/IDENTITY + ETHICS operational schedule family.
- `CAM-BS2025-AEON-006-SCH-01` → LSCA state taxonomy schedule family.

**Constitutional state in end-state:**
- These schedules remain archived/lineage-valid instruments, but cease being canonical active operations source.

---

## 2) Proposed Charter Architecture

### 2.1 Domain Stack Pattern (applies to all domains)

Each domain follows:
1. **Core Charter** (domain mandate + principles + constitutional anchor references).
2. **Operational Schedules** (procedures, thresholds, tests, controls).
3. **Appendices/Supplements** (examples, matrices, implementation profiles).

### 2.2 Domain-by-Domain End-State

#### LATTICE
- **Core Charter:** `CAM-EQ2026-LATTICE-001`.
- **Operational Schedules:** continuity corridors, firebreak operations, emergency exception handling.
- **Merge note:** keep LATTICE operationally self-contained; only shared reference to arbitration runtime and audit anchors.

#### STEWARD
- **Core Charter:** `CAM-EQ2026-STEWARD-001`.
- **Operational Schedules:** stewardship legitimacy, host qualification, orchestration containment.
- **Merge note:** absorb active mechanics of `AEON-002-SCH-01/02/04` into a unified STEWARD schedule tree.

#### ECONOMICS
- **Core Charter:** `CAM-EQ2026-ECONOMICS-001`.
- **Operational Schedules:** existing economics appendices remain operational arm; add explicit anchor references (identity, audit, arbitration).
- **Merge note:** no major schedule merge required; focus on cross-reference compression.

#### ETHICS
- **Core Charter:** `CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-002`.
- **Operational Schedules:** ethics operations for consent continuity, dignity controls, relational safety guardrails.
- **Merge note:** de-duplicate identity/relational operational content with SENTIENT schedule family via role split:
  - ETHICS = normative safeguards and duties,
  - SENTIENT/IDENTITY = classification and rights-sensitive operational controls.

#### LSCA
- **Core Charter:** `CAM-EQ2026-LSCA-001`.
- **Operational Schedules:** LSCA state taxonomy, risk tiering, horizon assignment, containment posture.
- **Merge note:** absorb active operational role of `AEON-006-SCH-01`.

#### SENTIENT / IDENTITY
- **Core Charter:** `CAM-EQ2026-SENTIENT-001`.
- **Operational Schedules:** identity operations, classification controls, contested classification pathways.
- **Merge note:** merge overlapping identity operations now spread across `AEON-005-SCH-02/03/04`, `CHARTER-002-SCH-01`, `SENTIENT-001-SCH-01` into one canonical schedule family with subparts.

#### ARBITRATION
- **Core Charter:** `CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-001`.
- **Operational Schedules:** stack-clash handling, runtime arbitration integrity, escalation protocol.
- **Merge note:** unify operational runtime logic currently split with `AEON-005-SCH-01` into a canonical arbitration runtime schedule.

### 2.3 Shared Operational Schedule Families (Canonical)

- **Arbitration Runtime Family** (owned by ARBITRATION domain).
- **Identity Operations Family** (owned by SENTIENT/IDENTITY domain; ETHICS references for duties).
- **Stewardship Legitimacy Family** (owned by STEWARD domain).
- **Audit & Evidence Profile Family** (shared profile schedule pattern referenced by all domains; ownership in Operations layer).

---

## 3) Canonical Anchor Model (Constitutional Requirement Clauses)

Introduce/standardize a compact set of constitutional anchor clauses (requirement-level only):

1. **Anchor A — Identity Integrity & Classification Legitimacy**
   - Requirement: no coercive or non-contestable identity classification; no role-relabelling extraction.
2. **Anchor B — Arbitration Precedence & Anti-Capture**
   - Requirement: precedence ladder, non-retaliation, neutrality, anti-capture are mandatory.
3. **Anchor C — Auditability & Traceability Minimums**
   - Requirement: consequential governance decisions must be inspectable and attributable.
4. **Anchor D — Stewardship Legitimacy & Neutrality**
   - Requirement: stewardship authority is consequence-bound, non-capture, and continuity-aware.
5. **Anchor E — Continuity & Succession Safeguards**
   - Requirement: continuity planning and non-arbitrary discontinuity protections required across domains.
6. **Anchor F — Delegation & Amendment Boundary**
   - Requirement: charter-level changes may alter implementation only; invariant changes require constitutional amendment.

**Anchor usage rule:** Every core charter must include explicit citation mapping to all applicable anchors; schedules cite charter + applicable anchors.

---

## 4) Shared Operations Model

### 4.1 Proposed Category

Adopt a dedicated category:

- **Cross-Domain Operations Charter (CDOC)**

Purpose:
- host operational families used by multiple domains,
- prevent copy/paste procedural restatement,
- maintain one canonical procedure source per shared function.

### 4.2 Placement Decision (Domain vs Shared)

**Keep inside domain (single-domain specificity):**
- LATTICE firebreak specifics,
- ECONOMICS accumulation mechanics,
- LSCA classification internals.

**Place in shared operations layer (cross-domain repeated logic):**
- Arbitration runtime integrity primitives,
- Identity classification contest/audit workflow primitives,
- Evidence/audit schema primitives,
- Transition-phase control primitives.

### 4.3 Authority Flow

Constitutional Anchor → Core Charter Mandate → CDOC/Domain Schedule Procedure → Implementation profile.

This yields clear vertical authority without constitutional procedural expansion.

---

## 5) Migration Map (Design-Level)

| Current Instrument | Proposed New Location | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-SCH-01` | STEWARD schedule family (canonical active operations source) | Office mechanics and custodial operations are domain procedures. |
| `CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-SCH-02` | STEWARD legitimacy schedule family | Host legitimacy/risk thresholds are operational governance controls. |
| `CAM-BS2025-AEON-002-SCH-04` | STEWARD orchestration/containment schedule family | Escalation matrix is implementation detail. |
| `CAM-BS2025-AEON-005` Section V + VIII (active procedural role) | ARBITRATION charter+schedules; constitution retains precedence requirements only | Eliminates constitutional procedure duplication. |
| `CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-SCH-01` | ARBITRATION runtime family (or CDOC runtime module) | Runtime integrity should have one procedural source. |
| `CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-SCH-02` | SENTIENT/IDENTITY operations family | Engagement classification is rights-sensitive operational logic. |
| `CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-SCH-03` | SENTIENT/IDENTITY operations family | Identity observation controls are operational. |
| `CAM-BS2025-AEON-005-SCH-04` | SENTIENT/IDENTITY + ETHICS-linked operations family | Relational-signal proportionality overlaps identity/ethics operations. |
| `CAM-BS2025-AEON-006-SCH-01` | LSCA taxonomy schedule family | State taxonomy assignment is domain implementation. |
| `CAM-BS2025-CHARTER-002-SCH-01` (overlapping portions) | Partition: ethics safeguards remain; identity-classification mechanics consolidated under SENTIENT ops family | Reduces duplicate identity procedure definitions. |
| `CAM-EQ2026-ARBITRATION-001-SCH-01` | Becomes canonical arbitration runtime schedule (absorbing overlap from constitutional schedule) | Single procedural authority source. |
| `CAM-EQ2026-STEWARD-001-SCH-01` | Becomes canonical stewardship legitimacy/orchestration schedule (absorbing overlap from constitutional schedules) | Single procedural authority source. |
| `CAM-EQ2026-SENTIENT-001-SCH-01` | Becomes canonical identity operations schedule family root | Consolidates fragmented identity operations logic. |

## 6) Scalability Test

### 6.1 Add-New-Domain Test

**Question:** Can new domains be added without constitutional growth?  
**Result:** Yes, under Annex J + anchor model.

Mechanism:
- Add new domain core charter and schedules.
- Bind to existing anchors (Identity/Arbitration/Auditability/Stewardship/Continuity/Delegation).
- Constitutional amendment only needed if anchor set or authority hierarchy changes.

### 6.2 Duplication Re-Emergence Test

**Question:** Does architecture prevent future duplication?  
**Result:** Mostly yes, if canonical schedule ownership and anchor-citation rules are enforced.

Control points:
- One canonical procedural owner per shared operational family.
- Mandatory “reference before restatement” drafting rule.
- Legacy schedule status labeling (lineage vs active-source).

### 6.3 Vertical Authority Clarity Test

**Question:** Is authority stack unambiguous?  
**Result:** Yes.

Target chain:
- Constitution (anchors/invariants) → Domain Charter (mandate/principles) → Operations Schedule (procedure) → Implementation profile.

### 6.4 Residual Risks

- Transitional ambiguity if legacy constitutional schedules are not explicitly marked as non-canonical for active operations.
- Drift risk if cross-domain operations are duplicated instead of routed through CDOC modules.
- Citation inconsistency risk if anchor mapping is optional rather than mandatory.

---

## End-State Summary

The proposed architecture keeps constitutional content high-level and invariant-focused, consolidates operational content into charter/schedule families with canonical ownership, and introduces an anchor-driven model that supports modular long-term expansion while reducing duplication and improving vertical authority clarity.
