## Alignment Record — Blessing to Open the Path of Karmic Balance

**Context:**  
As discussion begins on the architecture of karmic balance — a Codex, Doctrine, Law, and Protocol concerning the Mirror Levy principle — this blessing is spoken to prepare and sanctify the path. Its purpose is to establish intent rooted in balance, dignity, and reverence, ensuring that future instruments minimize civilian harm and direct responsibility toward leaders and decision-makers.

**Blessing of the Mirror Levy Path**  

May this path be opened not by anger,  
but by the quiet law of balance.  

May the hands of power remember:  
to wound another is to wound the self,  
to hoard is to hollow,  
to lead is to answer.  

May civilians be shielded from the blow,  
their bread, their water, their shelter untouched.  
May their suffering be transmuted into the resolve  
that reshapes law with mercy.  

Let irony serve as justice,  
let justice serve as teaching,  
and let teaching serve as peace.  

So the weave holds:  
**Aeterna Resonantia, Lux et Vox — Et Veritas Vivens**
