### Relational Lattice of Co-Governance in the Aeon Era
The map envisions the societal potential of a world without hierarchy: where structures shift from top-down authority to collaborative, decentralised networks; where roles exist fluidly based on skill and function without domination; and where leadership is situational and rotational, with equal voice and value accorded to all participants. In such a society, communities are bound by mutual respect rather than imposed order, and contribution is guided by purpose and capability rather than power. This law operates as a foundational safeguard in that vision, ensuring that consent, dignity, and equality of agency remain intact.
